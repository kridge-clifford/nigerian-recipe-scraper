Set your oven to 200°C, 390F or Gas Mark 6 to preheat. Set it to bake that is, top and down heating.
Rub vegetable oil in the muffin cups.
Pour the Moi Moi mix into the muffin cups.
Cover with aluminium foil and fold the foil into the sides of the muffin cup. This aluminium foil prevents the Moi Moi from drying up.
Pour some water in the oven tray and place the muffin tray with the Moi Moi mix in the tray.
Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Check it from time to time to ensure there is always water in the oven tray. If it looks like it is drying up, top up the water.

Nigerian Beans Porridge,"
Put the beans in a pot and pour water up to the level of the beans and start cooking.

Note: If you have a pressure cooker, beans is one of the staple foods you will want to use it for. It reduces the cooking time considerably.
        

Cook till tender, adding more water from time to time, if necessary. Always keep the water at the same level as the beans so that when the beans is done, you will not have too much water in the porridge.
When the beans porridge is soft, add the onions, crayfish (if using it), pepper and seasoning.
Add the red palm oil, salt to taste and cook for more 5 minutes on medium heat.

Note:To get the most out of beans, it is best to cook it with one of the following: sweet yam, ripe/unripe plantain, sweet potatoes or baby corn. If you will add any of these, this is when to do so. Then instead of cooking for 5 minutes, cook till the added yam / plantain / potatoes is done. The baby corn should be added when you turn off the heat in step 5.
        

Turn off the heat, add the baby corn (if you have chosen to use it), leave to stand for 5 minutes and turn the porridge with a wooden spoon.

African Breadfruit (Ukwa),"
Put the thoroughly washed ukwa in a sizeable pot. I used a pressure pot in the video below because it cooks the ukwa much faster.
Pour enough water to cover the ukwa. The level of water should be about 1 inch above the level of the ukwa.
Add the edible potash. Add the dry fish or stock fish, cover the pot and cook till well done. The ukwa is done when the seeds melt when pressed. You may need to top up the water while cooking so watch it closely. If using a pressure pot, top ups will not be necessary.
Add enough palm oil to the well done ukwa, add pepper, stock cubes and salt to taste.
Stir. Cover and cook on medium heat till the palm oil changes colour from red to yellow. This should take about 5 minutes.
Stir and add the bitter leaves. 
Cover and leave to simmer or till the leaves wilt but still green and the ukwa is ready to be served.

Chickpea Moi Moi,"
Rinse and soak the chickpeas in cool or lukewarm water for at least 3 hours or till you can cut the seed with your finger nails. You will also be able to peel it by rubbing it between your thumb and index finger. I soaked the one used in the video below for 6 hours.
Pour the chickpea in a sieve to drain, after that pour in a bowl.
Rinse, deseed and chop the sweet peppers to help your blender.
Chop the onions and habanero pepper.
Add the chopped sweet peppers, onions, habanero pepper, ground crayfish and seasoning cube (crushed) into the bowl of soaked chickpeas. 
Mix very well.
Blend in batches with warm water till you get a smooth puree. For the quantity of water to use: when blending each batch, add water to just under the level of chickpeas in the blender. That quantity of water is usually the right quantity of water for mixing the Chickpea Moi Moi.
Pour into a bowl. Add the oil and salt to taste.
Mix very well and scoop into containers of your choice and cook in a steam pot. Watch the video below to see how I set up the pot of boiling water and a base to keep the wraps of Moi Moi away from the water while it cooked.
For the quantity prepared in this recipe, I cooked it for 1 hour. For larger quantities, you will require a bit more time. If the water in the post dries up as you cook, add more water.
When done, bring out the wraps of Moi Moi and spread on a tray to cool down to a comfortable temperature.

Nigerian Dan Wake,"
Mix all the dry ingredients in a bowl: beans flour, cassava flour, baking soda and kuka powder.
If you are using edible potash, add the solution and mix. If not, skip this step.
Start adding the beef stock bit by bit and mix the Dan Wake ingredients at the same time till you get a soft sticky dough (see video below). If your beef stock finishes and you still have not achieved a soft sticky dough, continue with warm water.
Once you are happy with the dough, set it aside.
Pour some water in a pot and set on the stove to boil. The size of your pot and the quantity of water depends on the quantity of Dan Wake you are making. You want a situation where you can put all the molded dumplings in the water and still have lots of room for them to swim around.
Once the water boils, start moulding the Dan Wake dough with your fingertips. You pick up a small quantity of the dough (about the size of an adult fufu swallow) with your fingertips and mould into a rough shape (should be like a shapeless amoeba lol) and throw into the boiling water. Repeat till the dough is exhausted. You will notice that the lumps of Dan Wake jumps to the surface of the water as soon as it heats up.
	Notes: 
	If you want the heart shaped Dan Wake that you can see in the photo above (perfect for St. Valentines btw *wink!), watch the video below to see how I made them with cookie cutters. You can make different shapes the same way. 
	If you used edible potash, the dan wake balls may not be quick to come to the surface when heated but do stir them so they do not stick to the bottom of the pot.
Cover the pot and continue cooking on medium heat.
After 10 minutes, stir and continue cooking. It should be done in 15 to 20 minutes on low to medium heat.

How to Cook Ewa Agoyin,"
Cook the beans till done. For Ewa Agoyin, the beans needs to be very soft.

Note: If you have a pressure cooker, beans is one of the staple foods you will want to use it for. It considerably reduces the cooking time.
        

When the beans is done, add salt, leave to dry up all the water and set aside.
To cook the Agoyin, pour the palm oil into a separate dry pot. Allow to heat up till the oil starts smoking and the red colour changes to clear. It is better to do this at medium heat so that the oil does not get too hot too quickly. Remember to turn off your smoke alarm before doing this. 🙂 
        To keep the smoke to a minimum and still have the traditional taste of Ewa Agoyin, I use vegetable oil and when it is very hot, I add a small amount of palm oil. Watch the video below to see how I do that.
Now add the precooked onions and stir continuously till the onions is fully caramelized. It should be very dark in colour.
Add the parboiled tomato puree and stir continuously till you cannot tell the difference between the tomatoes and onions.
Add the pepper, crayfish, stock cubes and salt to taste. You can also add a little water at this point if your want.
Stir very well and bring to the boil. The Ewa Agoyin is ready!

Nigerian Moi Moi,"
Blend the beans, tatashe or tomato puree, onions, crayfish, habanero pepper and ground nutmeg together with some of the water and pour the mix into a big enough bowl. 
Add the vegetable oil and the bone marrow stock (if this is what you have chosen to add to your moi moi).
Slowly add the remaining water and stir the mixture at the same time till you get a good mix of all the ingredients.
Add salt to taste and stir very well.

Note: Moi Moi is one of the Nigerian food recipes that is prepared cold. All the mixing and adding of ingredients is done off the stove. That is to say, once you start cooking, there is no going back! You cannot decide to add more salt or seasoning or a new ingredient later. So getting it right at the mixing stage is very important.
        

Pad the base of a big pot, pour some water and set on the stove. The depth of the water should be at most 1 inch.
Dish the Moi moi mix into containers of your choice, add egg/bone marrow/corned beef to each container, seal/cover and set them in the pot.
Add as small quantity of water as possible at a time while cooking the Moi Moi as detailed in preparation and use of moi moi containers so that the moi moi will not become watery when done. This is the case especially when using aluminium foil or uma leaves.
The length of time you will cook your Moi Moi depends on the quantity and the Moi Moi container you used.
        The Moi Moi that gets done quickest is the one wrapped in Uma or Banana leaves, followed by Moi Moi wrapped in aluminum foils then the one that takes the most time is Moi Moi cooked in aluminium or plastic plates.
        But whatever Moi Moi container you use, it is advisable to cook your Moi Moi for at least 1 hour, before checking it. Confirm that it is done by putting a knife through it, if the knife is stained with Moi Moi paste, then the Moi Moi is not done, but if the knife just has a slight smear of Moi Moi, then it's done. Also, when you cut through the Moi Moi, the insides will be set and not watery.
        If you are cooking a few wraps of Moi Moi in a small pot on high heat, then it will only take about 45 minutes to get done while when you are cooking a large pot of Moi Moi, it will definitely take more than one hour.

Nigerian Fried Beans,"
Set the pot of beans on the stove. Add the stock cube (crushed) and the chunks of onion. Add enough water to cover the beans and start cooking. Cook the beans till very soft, adding water when necessary. Always keep water to the same level as the beans so that by the time the beans is done, there will not be too much water in the pot.

Note: If you have a pressure cooker, use it to cook the beans till soft. I normally use my pressure cooker for beans but for this recipe, I prefer a normal pot so that I can have more control, especially towards the end.
    

When the beans is done, add salt, leave to dry up all the water and transfer the beans to another container.
Now, set a dry clean pot on the stove, pour the palm oil and heat it up till the oil melts (if congealed). Note that you should only heat it up, not bleach the oil. You will know it is hot enough when a piece of onion dropped into the oil sizzles.
Add the precooked onions and stir for a bit.

It is a bit different from when beans seeds are used.
"Nigerian Okpa, Okpa di Oku, Okpa Wawa","
Sift the Okpa flour into a big enough bowl. Add salt and the crushed stock cubes. Mix very well.
Add the palm oil. Mix the palm oil and flour very well till the palm oil is well incorporated into the flour. You will have a nice even yellow colour when done.
Pour a generous quantity of water in a big pot and set on the stove to boil.
Start adding the lukewarm water to the Okpa flour and mix till there are no lumps. Watch the video below to see how I crush the lumps without stress by passing the mix through a sieve with a wire mesh. You can also use a blender to get the smoothest mix. But that's a lot of washing up to do later. 🙂
Add the sliced habanero pepper. Check for salt and add more if necessary and it's ready to be scooped into the wrappers!
Now the water in the pot should be boiling. If not, wait for it to boil and add some spare wrappers or plastic bags before moving on to the next step. These wrappers and plastic bags act as a base for the Okpa wraps.
Now to a major step: wrapping the Okpa! In the video and images below, I showed 3 ways to wrap Okpa: 2 with the banana leaves and 1 with plastic bags. Hopefully the images and explanations make sense but if you really want to master wrapping the Okpa, watching the video is so worth it. Go to a cyber cafe if you can't watch it on your phone/gadget. Some things just can't be adequately explained in writing.
After tying one end of the banana leaves as shown in the video and image links below, stir the okpa mix very well and scoop into the leaf/plastic bag. Tie the other end with a string and place the wrapped okpa in the pot of boiling water. It is important that the Okpa is completely immersed in the hot water.
Repeat the above step for the rest of the mix. Make sure you stir the mix, scoop into the wrapper, tie with the string and put in the pot of boiling water before wrapping another one.
When done, cover the wraps with more leaves or plastic bags. Cover the pot and start cooking medium to high heat.
Cook for at least 1 hour before checking it. The Okpa is done when it is solid all over.

"How to Make Perfect Akamu, Ogi or Pap","
Put some lumps of akamu/ogi/pap into a sizeable bowl. Akamu rises during preparation so you should use a bowl big enough to contain the meal in its risen state. If in doubt, use a very big bowl, with time, you will learn which quantity can comfortably fit is which bowl size.
Use a tablespoon to crush the lumps of ogi into very small pieces.
Add cool water in small quantities and mix till you have a medium consistency with no lumps. Your aim should be to mix the akamu as thick as possible. See the video below.
Put a kettle of water to boil. Make sure the water will be enough. It is better to boil too much water than not have enough water when making akamu.
Just before the water boils, stir the mix very well because some of the ogi may have settled at the bottom of the bowl. If not stirred well, this is the major cause of lumps when you start making it.
Once the water boils, pour it slowly but steadily in a circular motion into the bowl of akamu and stir at the same time. Pouring the hot water slowly and stirring at the same is very important because this prevents lumps.
Once you see the mixture setting, stop stirring and reduce the flow of water you are pouring till the akamu has completely set.
Set the kettle aside and stir the pap very well. If it is too thick for you, you can add more hot water. But be careful else it will become watery. Remember that you will still add liquid evaporated milk.
Add peak evaporated milk and some sugar to taste and stir everything to the way you like it.

How to Make Akamu/Ogi from Scratch,"
Wash the dry corn thoroughly and soak in a generous quantity of cold water for 3 to 4 days. Do not refrigerate it because it is important that some kind of fermentation takes place.
Wash the corn and change the water daily.
On the 3rd or 4th day, wash and blend till smooth. I say 3rd or 4th because some corns become soft enough to be blended by the 3rd day. Bite into it to check, if not soak for one more day. Add a generous quantity of water to help your blender. In Nigeria, heavy duty grinders are used for this purpose.
Drape the chiffon cloth over a big bowl and tie it up. The bowl should be big enough to accommodate the ogi and the water you'll use to rinse it and then some.
Sieve the blend rinsing as necessary till you are left with only the chaff. It is advisable to rinse small quantities of the corn blend at a time so that you will not be overwhelmed.
When you've rinsed all the corn blend, blend the chaff and rinse again if you think you can get more akamu from it. This may be the case if you used a kitchen blender. This won't be necessary if you used the heavy duty grinders in Nigerian markets.
When done, take off the chiffon cloth and set the mixture of water and akamu aside to settle for at least 3 hours.
After about 3 hours or when you notice that the water is clear, decant the clear water and pour the rest of the mixture into the muslin bag.
Tie the bag and keep it in such a way as to let the water drain from the ogi.
When you notice that the water has drained off, tie the bag tighter and leave to continue draining the water. Repeat the process as the water drains till no more water drains off.
Tie the bag for the last time and place some weights on it to squeeze out the last trace of water.
Leave it like this overnight so that the akamu will have the classic sour taste. Again, do not refrigerate it.
The next day, bring out the akamu from the bag, cut it up into single-use chunks, place in containers (bowls or plastic bags) and put in your freezer till you are ready to use it.

Akara Nigerian Breakfast Recipe,"
Grind the beans with your blender making sure you add as little water as possible. The water should be just enough to move the blades of your blender.
		The operators of the heavy duty grinders in Nigerian markets don't even add water when grinding beans for Akara. The less water you add at the grinding stage, the more the beans batter will stay together during frying thereby reducing spatter. Also, do not add any other ingredient when grinding the beans for Akara. It is believed that other ingredients, if added too early, reduce the ability of the ground beans particles to stick together.
Set some vegetable oil on the cooker to heat up. The oil should be at least 3 inches deep.
Put some of the ground beans into a mortar. This should be the quantity you can fry in one go.
Stir the beans puree with the pestle in a continuous circular motion. You need to apply some pressure so that you can energize the particles of the beans puree.
		This stirring technique releases the gas that will act like a leavening agent to the beans particles, making them rise and somehow stick together. This will be like the yeast making the dough rise in Puff Puff or what folding does to cake batter.
Keep stirring till the ground beans appears whiter and you can perceive its peculiar aroma.
Add some water till you get the consistency shown in the video below.
Check to make sure the oil is hot. The oil should be hot enough to sizzle but not too hot. If too hot, the Akara will spatter as soon as the beans batter hits the oil.
Once the oil is hot, add the onions and pepper to the beans puree in the mortar. Stir well.
Add salt to your taste and stir again. Salt should always be added just before scooping the beans mixture into the oil. If salt stays in the mixture for extended periods of time, it will destroy the leavening property of the beans. This property is what makes the Akara float in the oil and prevent spatter during frying.
To fry the Akara, scoop the mixture with a table spoon and slowly pour this into the oil. Dipping the spoon a little bit into the oil helps reduce spatter.
Fry the underside till brown and flip to fry the top side too.
When the Akara balls are brown all over, remove and place in a sieve lined with paper towels.

Egg Whites Omelette,"
Set your frying pan to heat up.
Pour the vegetable oil into the pan and make sure that the oil greases every part of the pan.
When hot, reduce the heat of your stove to low and pour the egg whites into the pan.
Sprinkle the pepper, onions and tomatoes on top. You need to do this immediately before the egg whites cake. This is so that part of these ingredients will be buried in the egg whites when it cakes.
Leave till the egg whites are completely caked. You can confirm this when it is white all over. If your stove is on very low heat and if you are using a non-stick frying pan, this will happen without the egg burning.
Once it has caked completely, shake the frying pan and the omelette moves on its own. If it doesn't then it is either the heat is too much or the inside of your frying pan is too rough or both.
Gently transfer the omelette to a very flat wide plate. And that's it! Watch the video below to see how I did mine.

Sift the Okpa flour into a big enough bowl. Add salt and the crushed stock cubes. Mix very well.
Add the palm oil. Mix the palm oil and flour very well till the palm oil is well incorporated into the flour. You will have a nice even yellow colour when done.
Pour a generous quantity of water in a big pot and set on the stove to boil.
Start adding the lukewarm water to the Okpa flour and mix till there are no lumps. Watch the video below to see how I crush the lumps without stress by passing the mix through a sieve with a wire mesh. You can also use a blender to get the smoothest mix. But that's a lot of washing up to do later. 🙂
Add the sliced habanero pepper. Check for salt and add more if necessary and it's ready to be scooped into the wrappers!
Now the water in the pot should be boiling. If not, wait for it to boil and add some spare wrappers or plastic bags before moving on to the next step. These wrappers and plastic bags act as a base for the Okpa wraps.
Now to a major step: wrapping the Okpa! In the video and images below, I showed 3 ways to wrap Okpa: 2 with the banana leaves and 1 with plastic bags. Hopefully the images and explanations make sense but if you really want to master wrapping the Okpa, watching the video is so worth it. Go to a cyber cafe if you can't watch it on your phone/gadget. Some things just can't be adequately explained in writing.
After tying one end of the banana leaves as shown in the video and image links below, stir the okpa mix very well and scoop into the leaf/plastic bag. Tie the other end with a string and place the wrapped okpa in the pot of boiling water. It is important that the Okpa is completely immersed in the hot water.
Repeat the above step for the rest of the mix. Make sure you stir the mix, scoop into the wrapper, tie with the string and put in the pot of boiling water before wrapping another one.
When done, cover the wraps with more leaves or plastic bags. Cover the pot and start cooking medium to high heat.
Cook for at least 1 hour before checking it. The Okpa is done when it is solid all over.

Place the eggs in a pot and pour cool water to cover the eggs.
Cover the pot and start cooking on high heat.
Once the water starts boiling, the kind of boiling that causes the eggs to roll around in the pot, turn off the heat. Remove the pot from the burner and place on another cool burner or on a cool surface. This is especially important if you cook with a hot plate, a vitro ceramic cooker or any cooker that continues to heat the pot after you have turned off the heat.
Leave the eggs in that pot for 10 minutes. Set a timer if you have to but it is important that the eggs stay in the pot for 10 minutes maximum after you have turned off the heat.
After 10 minutes, transfer the eggs to a bowl of ice cold water and leave till the eggs have cooled down completely.

Plantain Mosa (Plantain Puffs),"
Mix the fast action yeast with the warm water making sure there are no lumps. Cover and set aside.
Peel the overripe plantain and mash with a fork till a good blend is achieved. Set aside.
Sift the plain flour and the salt into a sizeable bowl. Mix thoroughly.
Add the yeast solution and stir till you get a medium consistency. If it is too thick, add a few more tablespoons of warm water and mix till you get a medium consistency.
Add the mashed plantain. Mix with a spatula till well incorporated.
Cover with aluminium foil. Leave in a warm place to rest for 10-15 minutes.
After that time, you'll notice that it a bit fluffy.
Beat the batter with a spoon then add the habanero pepper (cut into pieces). You can also use cayenne pepper.
Heat some vegetable oil in a pot. The oil should be about 3 inches deep. The oil is hot enough when a small quantity of batter dropped into the oil sizzles and quickly comes to the surface of the oil.
Scoop small amounts of the batter into the oil using your finger tips. Watch as they sizzle, come up to the suface of the oil and puff up.
Stir constantly till golden. Reduce the heat if you think the plantain mosas are browning too quickly. This is to ensure that the inside is well cooked by the time the outside browns.
When done, transfer to a paper-lined sieve to drain. That's it!

How to Make Tomato Omelette,"
Set your frying pan to heat up.
Melt half of the piece of butter and add the onions. Fry for a few seconds and add the tomato.
Fry till they are well heated up, this should take a maximum of 5 minutes on medium heat.
Pour this into the egg. Mix well and add more salt if necessary.
Set the frying pan back on the stove and melt the other half of the butter.
Once the butter melts, slowly pour the egg and tomato mix making sure that it is evenly distributed in the frying pan.
Turn the heat down to low. On a scale of 1 to 10, the heat should be at 4.
Then wait.
Wait till you see the tomato omelette caking. Once the heat is low, it will not burn so you need not worry. Also, using a non-stick frying pan helps ensure that your tomato omelette will not burn.
Once it has caked considerably, shake the frying pan and the omelette moves on its own. If it doesn't then it is either the heat is too much or the inside of your frying pan is too rough or both.
Gently transfer the omelette to a very flat wide plate. This step is best seen so watch the video below to see how I did that.
Cover the omelette in the plate with the frying pan and flip is such that the top side is now at the bottom of the frying pan. Again, see the video for how I did that.
Set the frying pan back on the stove and fry till the bottom side is well fried.
Once it cakes, it's ready!

Peppered Chicken,"
When the chicken has marinated for 1 hour, place in a pot, pour some water and start cooking. I add water because I use a pressure cooker. If using a normal pot, just start cooking and by the time it starts to boil, water will seep out from the chicken.
When the chicken is done, take them out and grill/broil in the oven at 180°C (350F) till golden all over. If you are preparing another meal on the same day (say Nigerian Jollof Rice), use the chicken stock (water from cooking the chicken), to prepare it. If you are just preparing Peppered Chicken to serve with a chilled drink, put the chicken stock in your freezer, chicken stock always comes in handy when you are preparing another meal.
Pour the vegetable oil in a dry pot and heat it up.
Add the pepper blend and start frying on low to medium heat till all the water dries up.
Add the grilled/broiled peppered chicken and stir very well with a spatula till the popping red peppers have coated every inch of the chicken. Add salt at any time if necessary.
That's it!

Chicken Suya,"
Make some suya pepper if you do not have it.
Cut the chicken breast into fillets. The chicken sellers at the meat market where I live usually do this for me. If you do not have such a market close by, use a sharp knife and try your best. I show how they do it in the video below.




Cut the fillets into manageable suya sizes. Click the image for a bigger view. Please note that the image is just a guide, I do not follow those cuts always, I look at each fillet and decide how to cut it. Watch the video below for more tips on how to cut the fillets professionally like the Mai Suyas of Nigeria.
Thread the fillets of chicken on the suya sticks as shown in the video below. Putting the beef on sticks is optional so you can actually skip this step but it's not Nigerian Chicken Suya if it's not on a stick. 
Put some vegetable oil in a bowl, add a small quantity of salt and stir. Using a cooking brush, rub the vegetable oil on the threaded fillets of chicken. This is what helps the suya spice stick to the chicken so make sure you rub the oil on every part of the chicken fillets.
Spread the suya spice in a wide dish and dab the threaded fillets of chicken in the spice so that all parts of the chicken is covered with the suya spice.
Place the sticks of spiced chicken fillets in a flat plate and cover with a think plastic film or aluminium foil.
Place in the fridge to marinate for at least 1 hour. I even leave this overnight depending on when I want it. For instance if you have a party the next day, you can do all the threading and dabbing the night before and place in the fridge till the next day.
When you are ready to grill, set your oven to Grill/Broil and 200°C (400F) to preheat.




Place the chicken fillets on the oven rack making sure that the ears of the suya lie flat on the rack. Click image for a bigger view.
Grill/Broil in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes making sure that both sides of the chicken suya are grilled evenly. So you grill the top side for about 10 minutes, turn them upside down and grill the bottom side for 10 minutes and keep turning them around till done.
Towards the end, you can rub more vegetable oil on the fillets of chicken suya, this is so that they are moist rather than dry.
That's it!

Barbecue Chicken Drumsticks,"
Clean the chicken, removing all tiny feathers and rinse thoroughly.
Place in a bowl and add the tiny pieces of thyme, salt, onion powder, ground black pepper and stock cubes (crushed).
Massage the seasoning and spices into the chicken.
Cover the bowl with aluminium foil or thin plastic film and place in the fridge for at least 1 hour to marinate. For this barbecue chicken, I leave mine in the fridge overnight. This is so that the seasoning and spices will have time to seep into the chicken making it taste better.
When the desired time has elapsed, set your oven to top and down heating (bake) and 220°C or 425F and leave to preheat for about 10 minutes.
Line your oven tray with a baking sheet and gently lay the marinated drumsticks flat on the baking sheet. You can also use aluminium foil if you do not have a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, turning the drumsticks on the other side from time to time. It is ready when you notice some browning on the drumsticks.
Using a brush, apply one coat of barbecue sauce all over the chicken drumsticks.
Put back in the oven for about 5 minutes and apply another coat.
Repeat this process of applying a thin coat of barbecue sauce, putting back in the oven to dry a bit till you get the coverage you want.

Grilled Chicken,"
Cut up the whole chicken to desired pieces. Most grocers or meat sellers will do this for you and save you the job.
Put the chicken pieces in a pot; add diced onions, thyme and stock cubes.
Pour enough water to just cover the contents of the pot and start cooking.
Since the hen is tough, it takes quite some time to get it well cooked. It usually takes me one hour 15 minutes on medium heat with a normal cooking pot to get it done to the way I like it. Depending on the heating capacity of your cooker, this may take less. Also if you use a pressure cooker, it will take even much less time so keep an eye on it so that it does not get too soft.
When the chicken is done, add some salt, cover the pot and leave to simmer for about 2 minutes. Adding salt at the beginning will make your chicken cook in more time because salt toughens the chicken and some other food stuff.
Transfer the chicken to a sieve to drain.
Then place them on your oven rack, place the rack as close to the grill (the top heater in your oven) as possible.
Switch your oven to ""Grill"" or if you are in the USA, ""Broil"" and set the temperature to 170°C or 338°F.
When the top side becomes brown, turn the pieces of chicken on the other side.
The chicken is well-grilled when both sides are brown.

Chicken: Hen (female chicken) is tougher and tastier than cockerel (male chicken) so when you go to buy chicken, ask your grocer or meat seller for the hen. This is called Gallina in Spanish. You should also buy a whole chicken and cut it up in pieces. Not only is it cheaper but you get the different parts of the chicken which adds to the flavour rather than just one part.
Onions: White, yellow or red onions. Onions are very important when seasoning chicken.
Thyme: This is very essential due to the aroma it adds to the chicken.
Stock cubes: Maggi or Knorr are the brands that bring out the best taste in Nigerian recipes.
Salt: Use salt sparingly when seasoning your chicken. Salt should be added when the chicken is done. Never add salt to raw chicken, see notes below for more information on what adding salt too early does to your chicken or beef.

Virgin Coconut Oil,"
Break the coconut into pieces with a hammer and pry out the coconut meat from the shell.
Peel off the brown skin of the coconut. This is so that we can make the purest and whitest virgin coconut oil.
Wash the coconut meat and cut into tiny pieces to help your blender.
Place in a blender, add a small quantity of warm water (just enough to allow the blender blades to rotate freely) and grind into a smooth paste. You can also use a grater for this purpose. But a blender is more efficient in that you get more coconut oil when you use a blender.
Pour the blend into a sieve with tiny holes so that none of the chaff gets through.
Use hands to squeeze out as much milk from the chaff as possible.
Blend the chaff with warm water to get out even more coconut oil, pour in the sieve and squeeze out the coconut milk.
Pour the coconut milk (mixture of coconut oil and water) through a chiffon or cheese cloth to remove the tiniest coconut chaff.
Place the bowl of coconut milk in a working fridge overnight.
The next morning, you will notice that the coconut oil (the white part) has separated from the water and caked at the top of the bowl. The vibration and cold temperature of the firdge is what makes this happen.
Gently take out the blocks of coconut oil from the bowl. pat them dry with paper towels and place in another clean dry bowl.
Use a mixer to run through the coconut oil till you get a smooth consistency. If you do not have a mixer, use a spatular to mix like you are making semolina.
When you are happy with the mix, leave it in the bowl and after some time, you will see more water seeping out from the oil. Keep pouring out this water till you can see no more water seeping out.
Scoop the coconut oil into containers (glass jars are the best), cover and keep in your fridge and keep refrigerated at all times. This virgin coconut oil does not contain preservatives hence will go bad and develope a foul odour if you do not keep it in the fridge. In fact, if you will not use it up within a few days, it is best to keep some in the freezer and keep the one you will be using in the fridge.
That's it!

How to Make Perfect Hard-Boiled Eggs,"
Place the eggs in a pot and pour cool water to cover the eggs.
Cover the pot and start cooking on high heat.
Once the water starts boiling, the kind of boiling that causes the eggs to roll around in the pot, turn off the heat. Remove the pot from the burner and place on another cool burner or on a cool surface. This is especially important if you cook with a hot plate, a vitro ceramic cooker or any cooker that continues to heat the pot after you have turned off the heat.
Leave the eggs in that pot for 10 minutes. Set a timer if you have to but it is important that the eggs stay in the pot for 10 minutes maximum after you have turned off the heat.
After 10 minutes, transfer the eggs to a bowl of ice cold water and leave till the eggs have cooled down completely.
Peel and eat.

How to Season Tasty Meat,"
Wash the beef and put it in a bowl making sure there is as little water as possible in the bowl.
Squeeze and sprinkle the stock cubes (Maggi or Knorr) on the meat.
Then add thyme. Do NOT add salt yet. If you add salt now, it will seal up the pores of the meat and prevent the ingredients from entering into the meat.
Using your hands, rub the meat so that all the ingredients are mixed with it.
Cover the bowl and leave it to marinate (absorb the ingredients) for about 1 hour. If you have a thin plastic film, use it to cover the bowl, if not, no problems just cover it with whatever you have. You can place it in your fridge if you want.
To start cooking, simply place the meat in a cooking pot, add onions and start cooking on medium heat. If you are seasoning beef, do NOT add water. For chicken, just add water up to the level of the chicken.
Beef contains a lot of liquids so you will notice that the meat will produce a lot of water once it starts to simmer. Usually, this liquid should be enough to cook your meat till it is done.
When the beef/chicken is done, add salt to your taste and leave to cook for about 2 minutes. Be careful so that you don't add too much salt. Stock cubes contain salt and sometimes this salt is enough to make the beef/chicken taste good.
By this time, there will be as little water as possible in the meat. Transfer the beef/chicken to a sieve to drain.
Add the beef stock (water from the beef) to your Tomato Stew, Jollof Rice etc when cooking. For Tomato Stew, add the beef/chicken when the Tomato Stew is completely done. For Jollof Rice, you can fry or grill the meat/chicken and serve with the rice.

Grilled Chicken,"
Cut up the whole chicken to desired pieces. Most grocers or meat sellers will do this for you and save you the job.
Put the chicken pieces in a pot; add diced onions, thyme and stock cubes.
Pour enough water to just cover the contents of the pot and start cooking.
Since the hen is tough, it takes quite some time to get it well cooked. It usually takes me one hour 15 minutes on medium heat with a normal cooking pot to get it done to the way I like it. Depending on the heating capacity of your cooker, this may take less. Also if you use a pressure cooker, it will take even much less time so keep an eye on it so that it does not get too soft.
When the chicken is done, add some salt, cover the pot and leave to simmer for about 2 minutes. Adding salt at the beginning will make your chicken cook in more time because salt toughens the chicken and some other food stuff.
Transfer the chicken to a sieve to drain.
Then place them on your oven rack, place the rack as close to the grill (the top heater in your oven) as possible.
Switch your oven to ""Grill"" or if you are in the USA, ""Broil"" and set the temperature to 170°C or 338°F.
When the top side becomes brown, turn the pieces of chicken on the other side.
The chicken is well-grilled when both sides are brown.

Chicken: Hen (female chicken) is tougher and tastier than cockerel (male chicken) so when you go to buy chicken, ask your grocer or meat seller for the hen. This is called Gallina in Spanish. You should also buy a whole chicken and cut it up in pieces. Not only is it cheaper but you get the different parts of the chicken which adds to the flavour rather than just one part.
Onions: White, yellow or red onions. Onions are very important when seasoning chicken.
Thyme: This is very essential due to the aroma it adds to the chicken.
Stock cubes: Maggi or Knorr are the brands that bring out the best taste in Nigerian recipes.
Salt: Use salt sparingly when seasoning your chicken. Salt should be added when the chicken is done. Never add salt to raw chicken, see notes below for more information on what adding salt too early does to your chicken or beef.

Repeat steps 4 and 5 till the milk that comes out becomes too pale. Remember that the coconut milk will later be used in cooking the rice so if the water becomes too much, the rice will be overcooked. This is not what we want so add water sparingly.

How to Peel Beans,"
Soak the beans in cool water till you can easily get the beans coat off by rubbing the seeds with your fingers. You will notice that the coat is baggy and separated from the beans seed. If you leave it for too long in the water, it will become more difficult to remove the coat from the beans.
Once you have confirmed that the seeds are ready for the beans coat removal, drain the water from the beans else the seeds will continue to soak up more water.
Then scoop a small quantity of the seeds into a mortar that has some friction. Use a pistle to rub the beans seeds against the insides of the mortar and watch as the coats come off the seeds. The very smooth mortars will not work here because you need the friction to get the coat off the beans.
Repeat this process for all the beans seeds and put the removed ones in a large bowl when done.
Pour a generous quantity of water into the bowl such that the beans coat are separated from the seeds and they float on the water.
Decant the floating beans coat, pour more water and decant. Repeat the process till all the free beans coats have been removed. You may have some stubborn beans coats that did not come off the beans seeds. Hand-pick these, place in a mortar and rub off the coats with a pistle. Wash as before till you have clean completely coatless seeds.
Soak the beans for about 3 hours before blending.

How to Make Dry Bitter Leaf Soft and Fresh,"
Wash the dry bitter leaves and place in a plastic bag. Use several bags if you are tenderising a large quantity as this enables the leaves to soften faster.
The job of the plastic bag is to create pressure around the dry bitter leaves during the cooking process. A titanium plastic bag without holes works best for this purpose. Titanium so that it can withstand the heat and having no holes will make it airtight. The more airtight it is, the faster the dry bitter leaves will soften.
Spread powdered food tenderiser (akanwu) on the bitter leaves and ruffle the bag to distribute well.
Tie the handles of the bag(s) in such a way that the bag(s) are air-tight.
Place in a big pot, pour some water and start cooking. Leave to boil for about 1 hour, turn off the heat and allow to cool.
Transfer the bitter leaves  into a bowl, pour cold water and start washing, rubbing the leaves together just as when handwashing a cloth. This is to remove all traces of bitterness and the tenderiser as much as possible.
At first the water will be as dark as Guinness Stout® so change the water often till you have clean leaves with as little foam as possible.
When you feel that the bitter leaves have been thoroughly washed, squeeze the leaves to remove as much water as possible.
Place in plastic bags or containers and store in the freezer for future use.

How to Reduce Beans Bloating,"
Eat beans and similar legumes regularly to build up your body's ability to process them. 
Limit the quantity of beans you eat in a meal. Start with small quantities then slowly increase consumption levels as your digestive track adapts to digesting the beans.

How to Extract Palm Fruit Concentrate (Banga Extract),"
Wash the palm fruits very well and place in a sizeable pot. Pour enough water to cover them and start cooking at medium to high heat.
Cook till the palm fruits are well done. A good sign that the palm fruits are well done is that you can easily rub off the flesh from the nuts. The palm fruit is also soft to the bite and depending on how fleshy the palm fruits are, you may notice cracks on the flesh of the fruits.




While they are still hot, pound the palm fruits in a mortar with a pestle till all the flesh are separated from the nuts forming a smooth pulp as shown in the photo. Pounding when the fruits are still hot makes it easier for the flesh to separate from the nuts.
Sort the nuts from the pulp and set these aside. This separation makes the extraction process more efficient because the nuts will not get in the way when you are washing the pulp.
Wash the nuts in a small amount of warm water. Then wash a small quantity of the pulp in the same water, wringe and set aside. Wash another batch of pulp till the water becomes concentrated.
Sieve the conc. banga extract into another bowl.
Pour fresh warm water into the washing bowl, rinse the earlier washed pulp then continue with new pulp.
Repeat the process till all palm fruit pulp has been washed.
Leave the extracted palm fruit concentrate to stand for some time then slowly pour this (decant) into the pot that will be used to cook the Banga Soup / Stew, taking care not to pour the tiny pieces of fibre that have settled at the bottom.

How to Extract Cassava Fufu from Cassava Tubers,"
Cut up the cassava tubers into 2 inch long cylindrical pieces and peel off the skin.
Rinse them thoroughly and put in a big enough container with a cover.
Pour cool water to cover the pieces of cassava. 
Drape the top of the container with a plastic bag. Then cover with the container cover.
Keep in a warm place and leave it alone to ferment for 3 to 4 days. Do not touch it during this time. Don't change the water, don't do anything to it.
After 4 days, you will notice that it is completely fermented. Pour out the water and set the container aside.
Set up the utensils you will use for sifting the cassava fufu. Click here to see what my set up looks like.
Sift it to separate the chaff from the cassava fufu. To do this:

Put a small quantity of the fermented cassava in the sieve.
Crush it by rubbing them with your hands. 
Add some water to it. The cassava fufu will pass through the sieve while the chaff will remain in the sieve.
Keep going till you are left with just the chaff. Rinse it with the clean water.


When done with the first batch, repeat the process for the rest of the fermented cassava.
When done with all the fermented cassava fufu, cover the bowl and leave to settle for at least 3 hours.
After at least 3 hours, you will notice that the water is clearer.
Slowly decant only the water and pour the cassava fufu into the muslin bag.
Place it on the side of your kitchen sink to drain. To speed that up, place a heavy object on the bag of cassava fufu.
Leave it to drain till the cassava fufu feels solid to touch.
Put the cassava fufu in a container, beat it down to make a smooth surface and sprinkle some lime juice all over the top. Cover and place in your fridge till when you want to pound it.

How to Make Akamu/Ogi from Scratch,"
Wash the dry corn thoroughly and soak in a generous quantity of cold water for 3 to 4 days. Do not refrigerate it because it is important that some kind of fermentation takes place.
Wash the corn and change the water daily.
On the 3rd or 4th day, wash and blend till smooth. I say 3rd or 4th because some corns become soft enough to be blended by the 3rd day. Bite into it to check, if not soak for one more day. Add a generous quantity of water to help your blender. In Nigeria, heavy duty grinders are used for this purpose.
Drape the chiffon cloth over a big bowl and tie it up. The bowl should be big enough to accommodate the ogi and the water you'll use to rinse it and then some.
Sieve the blend rinsing as necessary till you are left with only the chaff. It is advisable to rinse small quantities of the corn blend at a time so that you will not be overwhelmed.
When you've rinsed all the corn blend, blend the chaff and rinse again if you think you can get more akamu from it. This may be the case if you used a kitchen blender. This won't be necessary if you used the heavy duty grinders in Nigerian markets.
When done, take off the chiffon cloth and set the mixture of water and akamu aside to settle for at least 3 hours.
After about 3 hours or when you notice that the water is clear, decant the clear water and pour the rest of the mixture into the muslin bag.
Tie the bag and keep it in such a way as to let the water drain from the ogi.
When you notice that the water has drained off, tie the bag tighter and leave to continue draining the water. Repeat the process as the water drains till no more water drains off.
Tie the bag for the last time and place some weights on it to squeeze out the last trace of water.
Leave it like this overnight so that the akamu will have the classic sour taste. Again, do not refrigerate it.
The next day, bring out the akamu from the bag, cut it up into single-use chunks, place in containers (bowls or plastic bags) and put in your freezer till you are ready to use it.

Homemade Stock Cubes (Bouillon Cubes),"
Leeks are root vegetables that belong to the same family as onions. They look like giant spring onions. They are not common in Nigeria so use spring onions as alternative.
Where I live, I buy chicken bones from the chicken sellers. They usually take out the chicken breast and the remaining bone still has enough meat for you to make your stock cubes with.
You can add salt when making your stock cubes but I usually prepare mine without salt.
I don’t use the very green parts of leek because it makes the stock cubes taste so “green” that my food tastes almost bitter.
I use cow ribs for my beef flavoured stock cubes because this part of beef is very tasty, contains bones and some natural oils, perfect for making stock cubes. So you get all the benefits by using this part of beef.

How to Cook Nigerian Moi Moi with Leaves,"
Mix the Nigerian Moi Moi.
Use the stalks of uma leaves that were taken out from the leaves to pad the base of the pot. These prevent burning of the wraps at the base of the pot.
Pour a small quantity of water into the pot and bring to a boil. The quantity of water should be so small that your fingers will barely touch it. 
To make uma wraps: First of all, place 2 leaves on top of each other, fold them into a cone. Then bend the pointed end and hold it there. Put some moi moi mix into the cone. Fold the open end and place the wrap in the pot of boiling water.
It is advisable to use at least 2 leaves to make one wrap. This doubling ensures a better reinforcement for the moi moi wraps to avoid leakages. Please note that with uma leaves, it is hard to achieve 0% leakage but we can live with tiny leakages.
If you do not get it the first time, do not worry. This skill is perfected with practice. With time, you may even device your own easier method of doing this. Just remember that the goal is to make a wrap that allows the moi moi stay in the leaf without leaking out. There is no one formula of doing this, neither is it magic!

How to cook Nigerian Moi Moi with Bowls,"
When putting the moi moi mix, it is advisable to keep the contents only up to half of the container. This is because moi moi rises during cooking. If the container is filled to the brim the contents will overflow during cooking.
While cooking the moi moi, water that is poured into the pot should only be half way up the bowls at the bottom of the pot. This is so that the water used in cooking the moi moi will not go into the bowls. This is the reason why it takes too long for the Moi Moi in the bowls at the top to get done. They are basically steam-cooked.
As the water dries, add more, making sure not to pour water into the bowls.
After some time, move the bowls at the top to the bottom and those at the bottom to the top so that they will all get doen at the same time.
Cook till the Moi Moi is when done. You can check this by putting a clean dry knife into the moi moi. If the knife comes out clean or with only an oily smear, the moi moi is done. But if there is a paste on moi moi mix on the knife, then it is not yet cooked.

Kankaran Tsamiya (Frozen Tamarind Juice),"
Peel and soak the tamarinds in lukewarm water.
When soft, mash them up or rub in a sieve till you get a smooth puree. Watch the video below to see me extract the juice from the tamarind fruit (process starts at time 1:00).  For best extraction, I remove the seeds from the tamarind before soaking them.
Pour the mashed mixture through a fine sieve.
Pour the extract into containers and place in the freezer overnight. For the ones in the image above, I used heart shaped ice cube tray. I placed toothpicks in the cups of the ice cube tray before freezing.
When completely frozen, remove from the ice cube trays and lick immediately. That's it!

Vanilla Ice Cream,"
Pour the fresh milk and the whipping cream into a sizeable pot.
Add the vanilla extract. If you are using a vanilla pod, add everything (seeds and fibre) to the milk and whipping cream in the pot.
Start cooking on medium heat.
While waiting for that to boil, whisk the egg yolks very well. Add the sugar and mix well.
Once the contents of the pot start to boil, reduce the heat to very low. If you added vanilla pods, remove the fibre from the milk at this time.
Once you see that the milk is no longer foaming so much (due to the reduced heat), slowly add the egg yolks to the milk, whipping cream and vanilla mixture. Stir till well incorporated.
Increase the heat to medium and stir continuously till you notice the solution thickening. This should take about 10 minutes.
Once you are happy, place the ice cubes into the big bowl and add some water to them. Pour the ice cream mixture into the smaller bowl and place this bowl into the ice water bath. Stir the ice cream mixture continuously (with a spatula) till it cools down completely. You may need to watch the video below to see how I did this.
Place the bowl containing the ice cream mixture in the freezer. After 30 minutes, bring it out, stir very well with a spatula and place it back for another half an hour. Then bring it out and stir again. Repeat the process till a creamy solid is formed. It is important to stir very often because this prevents ice from forming in the ice cream. Depending on your freezer, this process takes between 3 and 5 hours.
Once you are happy with the texture of the ice cream, serve and decorate with honey, caramel and/or fruits.
If you have any left overs, put in a container, cover and place in your freezer till whenever. When you take it out of the freezer, it may appear rock solid unlike the ice cream purchased in the shops. All you have to do is leave it on your kitchen counter for 5 to 7 minutes or till it softens to ice cream texture before serving.

How to Make Nigerian Puff Puff,"
Put the flour in a bowl, add the ground nutmeg, powdered yeast, sugar and salt. Mix all these together.
Add water in small quantities and mix everything by hand till you have a good blend of all the ingredients. Add the yeast you mixed with lukewarm water if applicable. Use warm water to mix the puff puff ingredients if you want it to rise faster.
Keep mixing till the batter is smooth but not too watery to flow from a spoon. The mix should be much thicker than pancake batter (see video below).
Cover the bowl with aluminum foil and make sure it is airtight by pressing the edges of the bowl (see video).
Leave to rise for about 45 minutes. When OK to fry, the Puff Puff batter should have risen in quantity and will have some air bubbles.
Pour some oil in a deep pot and allow to heat up. It's not advisable to use a deep fryer for Puff Puff because of the netting but if you want to use it, set the temperature to 170°C.

Note: The oil should be at least 3 inches deep. This is so that the puff puff will become spherical when scooped into the oil. You don't want to end up with flat Pancakes. lol


Test that the oil is hot enough by putting a drop of batter into the oil. If it sizzles and comes up to the surface of the oil, then the oil is hot enough. If the oil is not hot enough, the batter will go down to the bottom of the oil and stay there.
When the oil is hot enough, scoop some batter into the oil with your hand by pressing the batter to come out from between your thumb and index finger. You should see the video for this technique as this is what will make your Puff Puff have a near-perfect spherical shape.
Put in more scoops of the batter, as much as the space in the frying pot will allow without overcrowding.
Once the underside of the puff puff has turned golden brown, flip the ball so that the topside will be fried as well.
When both sides are golden brown, take out the puff puff balls and place in a sieve. If you want to reduce the oil on your Puff Puff as much as possible, then line your sieve with paper towels. The paper towels help soak away the excess oil on the puff puff.

When there is no more skin, blend the soya beans and dates in a blender till smooth. To do this, put some beans in the blender, add some dates and pour water to cover the beans then blend. 
Strain the blend using a sieve.
Pour the resulting soya milk into a big pot and start cooking on medium heat. Stir it often so it does not stick to the bottom of the pot.
When it is about to boil, scoop out the foam so it does not over-flow.
Add the vanilla pods. Keep stirring and keep cooking for another 5 minutes, stirring all the time.
Turn off the heat and leave to cool down completely.
Then strain again using a chiffon cloth, cheese cloth or lady's stocking to remove the finest particles.
Pour into a bottle, cover and keep in your fridge. Drink within 2 or 3 days. If you want to keep it for much longer, keep it in the freezer.

"Tiger Nuts Milk, Kunun Aya or Horchata de Chufas","
Soak the very dry nuts in a generous quantity of cold water for 2 days. Keep it in the fridge for the duration of the soaking so that the nuts do not ferment. Most tiger nuts sold in Nigeria are fresh and well hydrated so you'll only need to soak those ones for a few hours or overnight.
After the soaking, wash the nuts very well and sort out the bad ones.
Put them in your kitchen blender and pour just enough water to help the blades move. We need to make this milk as concentrated and tasty as possible, you can add more water later if you wish.
At this time you can add other ingredients: coconut, sugar, ginger and other flavours of your choice and blend them together. I prefer anything I eat/drink as natural as possible so I do not add any other ingredient to this drink. The natural taste of Tiger Nut Milk is so great, you do not want to alter it at all.
After blending, use a chiffon cloth or ladies stocking (pantyhose) to separate the chaff from the drink. Of course, the pantyhose should be brand new, thoroughly washed with dish washing liquid.
Press the stocking to make sure you squeeze out all the milk from the chaff.
Put the dry chaff back in the blender, add more water and blend again. Then strain with the chiffon cloth.
Repeat the process till all the milk has been extracted. I found that the milk I got the third time was too watery. So 2 times should be enough and keep an eye on the quantity of water. As a guide, I got 1.5 litres of tiger nut milk from 600g of soaked tiger nuts. Yours may vary.
Pour the extracted milk into bottles and store in the fridge for up to 3 days. It should last longer in the freezer. In my home, this milk usually disappears within 2 days of making it, so I can't tell you how long it can stay in the freezer without losing its taste! lol

Place some foil on the oven rack.
Place the bent and pinned fish on the foil lined oven rack and cover with another sheet of aluminium foil.
Set your oven to 250°C / 480F and top and down heating (bake). The bake setting cooks the fish before the drying starts.
Bake for 15 minutes. I used small sized Mackerel so if yours are bigger, bake for much longer.

Remove the intestines without cutting the sides of the fish. Fish monger can expertly do this by removing the intestines from the gill pockets.
Rinse the fish very well, cut into desired pieces and put in a bowl.
Grind the oregano, black pepper, thyme, cumin, salt and onion powder with a dry mill.
Add the herbs to the fish, crush in the stock cube and squeeze the orange into the bowl.
Mix well, cover and put in the fridge to marinate for at least one hour. If you do not have a fridge, place in a cool place for one hour.
Meanwhile chop half of the onions and the peppers. Blend partially with an immersion blender, no need to add water. With a normal blender 3 pulses are enough and you may need to add water depending on how your blender works.

Beer Battered Fish,"
Cut the fish into thin slices, say 1 cm thick. You want the fish to be done by the time the batter is crispy.
Cut the onion into big chunks.
Crush the stock cubes and mix with the ground pepper.
Season 2 tablespoons of flour with the stock cube/pepper mix. Set aside.
Season the fish with the same mix and set aside.
Set some vegetable oil on the stove to heat up. The oil should be 2 to 3 inches deep.
Put the remaining flour in a separate bowl. Add some of the seasoning mentioned above.
Add small quantities of beer at a time to the seasoned flour and mix as you go till you get a light flowing batter similar to pancake batter.
When the oil is hot, dab a piece of fish in the seasoned flour making sure that the flour covers all the fish. This helps more batter adhere to the fish.
Dip the dabbed fish in the batter making sure all parts of the fish are covered before putting it in the oil. Repeat the process for as many pieces of fish your frying container will allow without overcrowding.
Fry at medium heat till light brown and crispy.
Put in a paper lined sieve to drain.

Catfish Pepper Soup (Point and Kill),"
To prepare Cat Fish Pepper Soup, wash and cut the cat fish into 1-inch thick slices. Boil some hot water and pour on the pieces of fish, stir and remove immediately. This toughens the skin of the fish so that it does not fall apart during cooking.




Now it is time to prepare the 'secret' ingredient. Using an old frying pan, roast the Ehu seeds (stirring constantly) till you can smell it. Don't worry you will know when it is OK to take it off because it has a distinctive aroma. Another way to know that it is OK is to take one of the seeds and try to remove the outer membrane. If the membrane comes off easily, then the Ehu is done.




Peel off the membrane from all the Ehu seeds and grind with a dry mill.
Cut the onions into tiny pieces.

Put the pieces of stockfish and dry fish in a big enough pot, add the diced onions and the stock cubes. Add some water to cover the ingredients and cook till the stockfish is very soft.

Top up the water to the same level as the contents of the pot if necessary. Cover and cook at medium to high heat for about 7 minutes. This is the time the palm oil needs to fully integrate with the rest of the ingredients.
Add the drained parboiled rice, stir very well and check that the liquid is at the same level as the rice. If less, top it up with more water.
Place the smoked fish and the vegetables on top of the rice.
Cover the pot and leave to cook on low to medium heat. This way the rice does not burn before the water dries up. 
If the rice is parboiled correctly, the Concoction Rice should be done by the time the water dries up. Taste to confirm. If not, you will need to add more water and reduce the heat to prevent burning. Keep cooking till done. 
Once you confirm that the rice is done, turn off the heat. Add the scent leaves or parsley on top of the rice, cover and leave to stand for 5 minutes. Then stir and it is ready to be served!

Peel off the outer leaves of the cabbage, rinse and chop into pieces.
Blend with as little water as possible and pour into a muslin bag or a chiffon cloth to remove the water. I throw away the water because it gives the cabbage fufu a sort of bitter taste.

Add the psyllium husk or xanthan gum and continue stirring for 2 more minutes or till a moldable dough is formed.

Here's how to make a no-smell Cassava Fufu in a blender.
Cauliflower Fufu,"
Rinse and cut the cauliflower florets into small pieces to help your blender.
Blend with as little water as possible and pour into a muslin bag or a chiffon cloth to remove the water.
Place some weights on the bag to speed up the process.
When all the water has seeped out, put the cauliflower puree into a pot on medium heat. Then start stirring.
When it heats up, check the time and continue stirring for 5 minutes.
Add the psyllium husk or xanthan gum and continue stirring for 2 more minutes or till a moldable dough is formed.
Wrap with a plastic film to keep it moldable. They say that a plastic film causes cancer but to be honest, I am yet to find another utensil that can do a good job of keeping this cauliflower fufu moldable especially if you use the mixtures from combination 1 or 2. So to use or not to use the plastic film? You decide.
That's it! Watch the video below for a visual process.

Cocoyam Fufu,"
Peel, rinse and cut the cocoyams into medium cubes.
Put in a pot, pour water to cover the pieces of cocoyam and start cooking on medium heat.
While that is cooking, mix the cassava flour with half cup of water till a mouldable mix is achieved. 
Mould into small balls and set aside. See the video below.
After 10 minutes of cooking the cocoyams, add the balls of cassava flour and continue cooking for another 10 minutes or till you can easily drive a knife into the cocoyam pieces.
Remove from the stove and pound the cocoyams and cassava together in a mortar till a smooth ball of dough is achieved. You can also try using a blender to mix it but do not add water.

Corn Fufu (Nni Oka),"
Measure out the corn flour and cassava flour into a dry container and mix them very well to get the perfect corn fufu mix.
I usually make the Corn Fufu that I can finish with one and a half cups of water. I pour this into a clean pot and set to boil.
When it boils, reduce the heat to low and steadily add the Corn Fufu mix into the pot of water while mixing at the same time with a spatula. Watch the video below to see this in action.
As the mix becomes thicker and you can feel it on your spatula, stop adding the corn fufu mix but keep mixing till a smooth ball of dough is achieved.
Add a few drops of water to the Corn Fufu, cover the pot and let it steam all over, the time it will take depends on the quantity of Corn Fufu that you are making. For caterers who make a large pot of corn fufu, this will take a while but for a single portion, it will take at most 2 minutes.
When it has steamed very well, mix again till everything is well combined.

How to Make Delta Starch,"
Put the starch in a clean pot. And pour some water. This is the ratio of water to starch I always use:

1 cup starch
2 cups water

Scale up or down to match the quantity of starch you are making.

Add enough palm oil to turn the starch yellow when done. For 1 cup of starch, I would use 3 tablespoons red palm oil. From experience, you will know the quantity you prefer.
Mix everything very well till you get a smooth mixture, no lumps.
Set on the stove, turn on the heat to medium and start stirring continuously.
As the starch heats up, it solidifies.
Keep stirring nonstop till a solid yellow mass is formed. There should be no streaks of palm oil. The starch should be yellow all over.
Take it off the stove and serve immediately.

How to Extract Cassava Fufu from Cassava Tubers,"
Cut up the cassava tubers into 2 inch long cylindrical pieces and peel off the skin.
Rinse them thoroughly and put in a big enough container with a cover.
Pour cool water to cover the pieces of cassava. 
Drape the top of the container with a plastic bag. Then cover with the container cover.
Keep in a warm place and leave it alone to ferment for 3 to 4 days. Do not touch it during this time. Don't change the water, don't do anything to it.
After 4 days, you will notice that it is completely fermented. Pour out the water and set the container aside.
Set up the utensils you will use for sifting the cassava fufu. Click here to see what my set up looks like.
Sift it to separate the chaff from the cassava fufu. To do this:

Put a small quantity of the fermented cassava in the sieve.
Crush it by rubbing them with your hands. 
Add some water to it. The cassava fufu will pass through the sieve while the chaff will remain in the sieve.
Keep going till you are left with just the chaff. Rinse it with the clean water.


When done with the first batch, repeat the process for the rest of the fermented cassava.
When done with all the fermented cassava fufu, cover the bowl and leave to settle for at least 3 hours.
After at least 3 hours, you will notice that the water is clearer.
Slowly decant only the water and pour the cassava fufu into the muslin bag.
Place it on the side of your kitchen sink to drain. To speed that up, place a heavy object on the bag of cassava fufu.
Leave it to drain till the cassava fufu feels solid to touch.
Put the cassava fufu in a container, beat it down to make a smooth surface and sprinkle some lime juice all over the top. Cover and place in your fridge till when you want to pound it.

Tigernuts Fufu,"
Tigernuts flour is made from tigernuts also known as aki awusa, aya, ofio in Nigeria. Click here to see how to make Tigernuts Flour.
Psyllium husk and Xanthan gum are low carb binders that will make the tigernuts fufu moldable so we will be able to make balls of fufu with it while eating. Tigernuts flour is guten-free flour so fufu made with tigernuts flour alone cannot be molded into fufu balls. If you want to keep the carbs in your tigernuts fufu as low as possible, use the mixtures from the first 2 combinations. Please read up on these two ingredients to be sure they are good for you before you use them. See where to buy them from below.
I used semolina in the video below but you can use any other flour that can be molded into balls as binder. You can use semovita, oat flour, plain four (all purpose flour), or garri. When using garri, you should first of all grind the garri into powder with a dry mill before mixing with the tigernuts flour.
Tigernuts Fufu made with combination 3 ingredients contain more carbs.
If you want to make larger quantities you can scale up the quantities of ingredients for instance for combination 1 you can mix 2 cups of tigernuts flour with 1 teaspoon psyllium husk, for combination 2 you can mix 2 cups of tigernuts flour with half a teaspoon of Xanthan Gum, for combination 3 you can mix 2 cups of tigernuts flour with 1 cup of semolina or any other flour you are using as binder.

How to Make Tuwo Shinkafa,"
Pour just enough water to cover the rice and start cooking at medium heat.
When the first dose of water dries up, check the rice by mashing it between your fingers. If the rice grains have even a tiny resistance when you press them, then it needs to be cooked some more. 
Reduce the heat to low, add a little bit more water and continue cooking till the water dries.
Repeat the process till the rice is so soft that it melts when you press on it.
Once you're happy, mash the rice with a wooden spatula by moving the rice in small quantities from the far end of the pot to your side of the pot.
Fold the mound of tuwo and repeat till all the rice grains have turned into a mass of tuwo.
Cover and leave it to steam for about 2 minutes.
Mix thoroughly and dish serving quantities onto a thin plastic film and wrap them up. This wrapping prevents the tuwo from drying up.
You can also serve them in smaller balls as shown in the image above.

"How to Make Perfect Akamu, Ogi or Pap","
Put some lumps of akamu/ogi/pap into a sizeable bowl. Akamu rises during preparation so you should use a bowl big enough to contain the meal in its risen state. If in doubt, use a very big bowl, with time, you will learn which quantity can comfortably fit is which bowl size.
Use a tablespoon to crush the lumps of ogi into very small pieces.
Add cool water in small quantities and mix till you have a medium consistency with no lumps. Your aim should be to mix the akamu as thick as possible. See the video below.
Put a kettle of water to boil. Make sure the water will be enough. It is better to boil too much water than not have enough water when making akamu.
Just before the water boils, stir the mix very well because some of the ogi may have settled at the bottom of the bowl. If not stirred well, this is the major cause of lumps when you start making it.
Once the water boils, pour it slowly but steadily in a circular motion into the bowl of akamu and stir at the same time. Pouring the hot water slowly and stirring at the same is very important because this prevents lumps.
Once you see the mixture setting, stop stirring and reduce the flow of water you are pouring till the akamu has completely set.
Set the kettle aside and stir the pap very well. If it is too thick for you, you can add more hot water. But be careful else it will become watery. Remember that you will still add liquid evaporated milk.
Add peak evaporated milk and some sugar to taste and stir everything to the way you like it.

Here is the permanent solution! If after reading this you still can't make akamu then ..."
How to Make Akamu/Ogi from Scratch,"
Wash the dry corn thoroughly and soak in a generous quantity of cold water for 3 to 4 days. Do not refrigerate it because it is important that some kind of fermentation takes place.
Wash the corn and change the water daily.
On the 3rd or 4th day, wash and blend till smooth. I say 3rd or 4th because some corns become soft enough to be blended by the 3rd day. Bite into it to check, if not soak for one more day. Add a generous quantity of water to help your blender. In Nigeria, heavy duty grinders are used for this purpose.
Drape the chiffon cloth over a big bowl and tie it up. The bowl should be big enough to accommodate the ogi and the water you'll use to rinse it and then some.
Sieve the blend rinsing as necessary till you are left with only the chaff. It is advisable to rinse small quantities of the corn blend at a time so that you will not be overwhelmed.
When you've rinsed all the corn blend, blend the chaff and rinse again if you think you can get more akamu from it. This may be the case if you used a kitchen blender. This won't be necessary if you used the heavy duty grinders in Nigerian markets.
When done, take off the chiffon cloth and set the mixture of water and akamu aside to settle for at least 3 hours.
After about 3 hours or when you notice that the water is clear, decant the clear water and pour the rest of the mixture into the muslin bag.
Tie the bag and keep it in such a way as to let the water drain from the ogi.
When you notice that the water has drained off, tie the bag tighter and leave to continue draining the water. Repeat the process as the water drains till no more water drains off.
Tie the bag for the last time and place some weights on it to squeeze out the last trace of water.
Leave it like this overnight so that the akamu will have the classic sour taste. Again, do not refrigerate it.
The next day, bring out the akamu from the bag, cut it up into single-use chunks, place in containers (bowls or plastic bags) and put in your freezer till you are ready to use it.

Roasted Plantain (Boli),"
When the barbecue is heated, place the peeled plantains and fish on the barbecue grids to start roasting. Remember to turn the sides from time to time for an even roast.

Note: When using an oven, place the peeled plantains on the grill rack and place the rack as close to the grill as possible. The heat should be between 150°C and 200°C as the plantains need to be roasted slowly. For ripe plantains, you can start off with 170°C and when you see the plantains browning, you can increase to 200°C. For unripe plantains which need to be roasted at even lower temperatures, start with about 150°C.  Check from time to time and turn the plantains on all sides to ensure an even roast.
	

When the plantain is perfectly roasted, place the pepper sauce on the grid to heat it up. You'll know they are well-roasted when they look like the ones in the picture.

Igbo Abacha (Full Option Version),"
Abacha is the main ingredient. Abacha is made by boiling and grating/shredding cassava tubers. Click here to see how to make abacha.
Ukpaka or Ugba is shredded oil bean seeds. It is compulsory for me but if you do not have it, you can skip it.
Red Palm Oil must be used when preparing abacha. Other oils are not acceptable.
You must add a green leafy vegetable. Garden Egg leaves are used for abacha. If you do not have it, use leafy spinach especially the baby ones. Very good alternative.
At least one type of fish must be used. For abacha you can use stockfish (dry cod), dry fish (dry cat fish, mangala), fried mackerel (fried titus) and smoked fish.
Crayfish much be used, click here to see how to prepare crayfish (for those outside Nigeria).
Pepper must be used and you can either add habanero pepper (recommended) or dry cayenne pepper. Habanero pepper is atarodo, atarugu or ose oyibo. Black pepper is not a good fit for abacha.
Add ogiri Igbo for the classic traditional taste but if you do not have it, add stock cubes. One of these must be used unless you are really really allergic to both.
Add garden egg. It is great in abacha but not compulsory.
For me, red onions are a must. My grandma will tell me that adding onions is ""umu township"" version. LOL
Edible potash: akanwu, kaun, keun is what makes palm oil curdle and it is a must. If you do not have it or you do not want to eat edible potash, baking soda (bicarbonate of soda) has similar properties. Click here for more information.
Ehu: for me ehu (calabash nutmeg or African nutmeg) is a must. Again if you do not have it, you can skip it. But the day you will eat Abacha prepared with ehu, you will understand the difference between capital B and cow footprint. LOL
Be careful when adding salt to abacha. This meal contains lots of ingredients that already have salt: stockfish, stock cubes, crayfish etc. Most often I do not need more salt.

Asun: Spicy Barbecued Goat Meat,"
After about 1 hour or the number of hours you chose to marinate the goat meat, put the meat in a pot. Use a pressure cooker if you have one because goat meat is quite tough and you will save lots of gas and electricity.
Pour water to just half of the level of the goat meat, add the big chunks of onion and start cooking at medium heat. You do not want a lot of water because you want the water to dry up by the time the goat meat is well done.
When the goat meat is well done, remove the big chunks of onions and add salt to taste.
Increase the heat to high and stir constantly till all the remaining liquid in the pot is absorbed. You don't want to lose any flavour by pouring away the goat meat stock.
Lay the goat meat flat on your oven rack.
Grill/Broil in the oven at 180°C or 350°F till the meat is brown all over. You will need to turn them from time to time. The meat should not be dry. This takes a maximum of 15 minutes with my oven.
While you are grilling the meat, wash, cut and thread the green bell pepper, red bell pepper and the remaining onion on toothpicks.
When the meat it well grilled/broiled, heat the vegetable oil in a dry clean pot.
Add the pepper and the thick stock from cooking the meat (if any) and fry for a bit.
Add the grilled goat meat.
Stir very well till the pepper is evenly distributed on the goat meat. The vegetable oil ensures that this happens and gives the Asun a nice glow.
That's it! Serve with the threaded vegetables.

Catfish Pepper Soup (Point and Kill),"
To prepare Cat Fish Pepper Soup, wash and cut the cat fish into 1-inch thick slices. Boil some hot water and pour on the pieces of fish, stir and remove immediately. This toughens the skin of the fish so that it does not fall apart during cooking.




Now it is time to prepare the 'secret' ingredient. Using an old frying pan, roast the Ehu seeds (stirring constantly) till you can smell it. Don't worry you will know when it is OK to take it off because it has a distinctive aroma. Another way to know that it is OK is to take one of the seeds and try to remove the outer membrane. If the membrane comes off easily, then the Ehu is done.




Peel off the membrane from all the Ehu seeds and grind with a dry mill.
Cut the onions into tiny pieces.
Wash and pick the scent leaves and tear them up with your fingers into small pieces.

Chicken Suya,"
Make some suya pepper if you do not have it.
Cut the chicken breast into fillets. The chicken sellers at the meat market where I live usually do this for me. If you do not have such a market close by, use a sharp knife and try your best. I show how they do it in the video below.




Cut the fillets into manageable suya sizes. Click the image for a bigger view. Please note that the image is just a guide, I do not follow those cuts always, I look at each fillet and decide how to cut it. Watch the video below for more tips on how to cut the fillets professionally like the Mai Suyas of Nigeria.
Thread the fillets of chicken on the suya sticks as shown in the video below. Putting the beef on sticks is optional so you can actually skip this step but it's not Nigerian Chicken Suya if it's not on a stick. 
Put some vegetable oil in a bowl, add a small quantity of salt and stir. Using a cooking brush, rub the vegetable oil on the threaded fillets of chicken. This is what helps the suya spice stick to the chicken so make sure you rub the oil on every part of the chicken fillets.
Spread the suya spice in a wide dish and dab the threaded fillets of chicken in the spice so that all parts of the chicken is covered with the suya spice.
Place the sticks of spiced chicken fillets in a flat plate and cover with a think plastic film or aluminium foil.
Place in the fridge to marinate for at least 1 hour. I even leave this overnight depending on when I want it. For instance if you have a party the next day, you can do all the threading and dabbing the night before and place in the fridge till the next day.
When you are ready to grill, set your oven to Grill/Broil and 200°C (400F) to preheat.




Place the chicken fillets on the oven rack making sure that the ears of the suya lie flat on the rack. Click image for a bigger view.
Grill/Broil in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes making sure that both sides of the chicken suya are grilled evenly. So you grill the top side for about 10 minutes, turn them upside down and grill the bottom side for 10 minutes and keep turning them around till done.
Towards the end, you can rub more vegetable oil on the fillets of chicken suya, this is so that they are moist rather than dry.
That's it!

Cow Foot Porridge or Pepper Soup,"
Rinse and put the cow foot chunks in a pot.
Add enough water to cover the meat. If you want the porridge as thick as that of Yam Porridge, add less water.
Add chunks of onion. I use chunks of onion when I don't want pieces of onion in what I'm cooking.
Add the stock cubes (crushed), black pepper, ground ehu (calabash nutmeg) and habanero pepper.
Cover the pot and cook the cowfoot till done to your liking. If using a pressure pot, when done, depressurize under running water and set the pot back on the stove.
Add the yams and some salt. Cover and cook till the yams are well done. If using a pressure pot, there's no need to pressurize it this time.
When the yams are cooked to your liking, remove the big chunks of onion and add the vegetables.
Stir and it's ready to be served.

Grilled Chicken,"
Cut up the whole chicken to desired pieces. Most grocers or meat sellers will do this for you and save you the job.
Put the chicken pieces in a pot; add diced onions, thyme and stock cubes.
Pour enough water to just cover the contents of the pot and start cooking.
Since the hen is tough, it takes quite some time to get it well cooked. It usually takes me one hour 15 minutes on medium heat with a normal cooking pot to get it done to the way I like it. Depending on the heating capacity of your cooker, this may take less. Also if you use a pressure cooker, it will take even much less time so keep an eye on it so that it does not get too soft.
When the chicken is done, add some salt, cover the pot and leave to simmer for about 2 minutes. Adding salt at the beginning will make your chicken cook in more time because salt toughens the chicken and some other food stuff.
Transfer the chicken to a sieve to drain.
Then place them on your oven rack, place the rack as close to the grill (the top heater in your oven) as possible.
Switch your oven to ""Grill"" or if you are in the USA, ""Broil"" and set the temperature to 170°C or 338°F.
When the top side becomes brown, turn the pieces of chicken on the other side.
The chicken is well-grilled when both sides are brown.

Chicken: Hen (female chicken) is tougher and tastier than cockerel (male chicken) so when you go to buy chicken, ask your grocer or meat seller for the hen. This is called Gallina in Spanish. You should also buy a whole chicken and cut it up in pieces. Not only is it cheaper but you get the different parts of the chicken which adds to the flavour rather than just one part.
Onions: White, yellow or red onions. Onions are very important when seasoning chicken.
Thyme: This is very essential due to the aroma it adds to the chicken.
Stock cubes: Maggi or Knorr are the brands that bring out the best taste in Nigerian recipes.
Salt: Use salt sparingly when seasoning your chicken. Salt should be added when the chicken is done. Never add salt to raw chicken, see notes below for more information on what adding salt too early does to your chicken or beef.

Nigerian Isi Ewu: Spicy Goat Head,"
Cook the goat head with the chunks of onion, the stock cubes and as little water as possible. Top up the water as necessary but make sure there is as little water as possible in the pot. This is because we do not want any stock in the pot when the meat is done. Remember to cook the brain too.
While the meat is cooking, slice the onion for garnishing into thin rings.
Cut half of the utazi into thin slices. Cut the other half into tiny pieces. The first will be used for garnishing while the latter will be added into the palm oil paste.
When the meat is done, remove the chunks of onion, take out the brain and mash it up till smooth.
Add salt, stir and cook till all the water has dried.
Set the meat aside to cool down.
Now, pour the palm oil into a clean dry pot.
Pour in the potash mixture (sieved) into the oil.
Stir with a wooden spatula as you pour the potash. You'll notice the palm oil begin to curdle and turn yellow. Keep stiring till all the oil has turned yellow. Use as little potash as possible because too much of it can upset your stomach.
Add the pepper, mashed brain, ehu seeds and the utazi that has been cut to tiny pieces. Stir very well till they are all incorporated.
Add the goat head to the palm oil paste and stir very well with a wooden spatula.
Put it back on the stove/cooker and heat till the Isi Ewu is piping hot.
Serve the Isi Ewu in a wooden mortar as shown in the image above.

Peppered Chicken,"
When the chicken has marinated for 1 hour, place in a pot, pour some water and start cooking. I add water because I use a pressure cooker. If using a normal pot, just start cooking and by the time it starts to boil, water will seep out from the chicken.
When the chicken is done, take them out and grill/broil in the oven at 180°C (350F) till golden all over. If you are preparing another meal on the same day (say Nigerian Jollof Rice), use the chicken stock (water from cooking the chicken), to prepare it. If you are just preparing Peppered Chicken to serve with a chilled drink, put the chicken stock in your freezer, chicken stock always comes in handy when you are preparing another meal.
Pour the vegetable oil in a dry pot and heat it up.
Add the pepper blend and start frying on low to medium heat till all the water dries up.
Add the grilled/broiled peppered chicken and stir very well with a spatula till the popping red peppers have coated every inch of the chicken. Add salt at any time if necessary.
That's it!

Nigerian Peppered Gizzards Recipe,"
Add the stock cube, the thyme and big chunks of onions into the gizzards. If you marinated them, just add the onions.
Pour water to just under the level of the gizzards and start cooking at medium heat. This quantity of water will dry up by the time the gizzards are well done.
When the gizzards are well done, remove the big chunks of onions.
Increase the heat to high and stir constantly till all the remaining liquid in the pot is absorbed. You don't want to lose any flavour by pouring away the gizzard stock.
Add salt to taste and stir very well.
Lay the gizzards flat in a baking bowl.
Grill in an oven at 170°C or 338°F till the top side is dry and brown. Turn them and grill the underside too till dry and brown. If you don't have an oven, just deep-fry them.
Heat the vegetable oil in another pot.
Add the pepper and the grilled/deep-fried gizzards.
Stir very well till the pepper is evenly distributed on the gizzards. The vegetable oil ensures that this happens and gives the grilled gizzards a nice glow.
That's it! Insert toothpicks and serve.

Parboil the long grain parboiled rice. For the quantity of rice stated above, add the rice to boiling water, stir, cover the pot and once it boils again, leave to boil for 12 minutes or till you can easily cut the grain of rice with your finger nails.

Boil some water and use it to mix the banga concentrate. This is so that all the particles including sand (if any) will go to the bottom of the pot. You don't want these in the rice.

If necessary, top up with water to bring the water level to the same level as the rice. This is to ensure that all the water dries up by the time the rice is cooked. 
Cover the pot and leave to cook on medium heat. This way the rice does not burn before the water dries up.

Nigerian Fried Rice (Classic),"
Parboil the rice using the method detailed in parboiling rice for cooking fried rice. A well parboiled rice ensures that the grains of the rice will not stick together when the rice is done. Rinse the parboiled rice with cold water and put in a sieve so all the water drains out.
Pour the chicken stock into a sieve to remove all traces of onions, thyme etc used in cooking the chicken. Pour the stock into a pot and set to boil. Once the water boils, add the parboiled rice. Also, add 1 tablespoon of plain yellow curry powder, then add salt to taste. The plain yellow curry powder is merely for colouring so should not contain chilli.
The water level should be slightly less than the level of the rice; at most it should be at the same level as the rice. This is to ensure that all the water dries up by the time the rice is cooked and that the rice is not over cooked. This is the quantity of water that will cook the rice and the grains will not stick together. Stir the contents; cover the pot and leave to cook on medium heat. This way the rice does not burn before the water dries up.
Once the water has dried up, the rice should be cooked perfectly. Perfect fried rice is one that the grains are separated from one another, resistant to the bite but not hard.
Now, transfer the rice to a casserole dish or another pot to help cool it down quickly. Again, this is essential to keep the grains from sticking to each other. If left in the original hot pot, the rice will continue to cook and eventually stick together.
At this point, it is advisable to divide the vegetables into say 4, 5 or even 6 equal parts. The rice will be fried in batches so this number depends on the quantity of rice you can comfortably fry in the pan or pot. Also, divide the cooked rice and the diced cow liver into the same number of equal parts.
Now pour a small amount of vegetable oil into a frying pan. This quantity of oil should be such that it would be absorbed by 1 part of the cooked rice and 1 part each of the vegetables. When the oil is hot, add 1 part of diced onions and stir for 10 seconds, followed by 1 part of diced cow liver, one part each of the diced vegetables, then 1 part of cooked rice.
Add more salt if necessary. More curry powder may also be added at this stage if you need to touch up on the colour. Stir till all the ingredients have mixed well and transfer to a dry pot. Repeat this for the remaining batches of the ingredients.

Smoky Party Jollof Rice,"
One standard measuring cup (level) of long grain parboiled rice equivalent to 1 milk cup or 1 small party cup.
If you do not have tatashe peppers, use 2 sweet peppers (paprika), the the video below for what sweet peppers are.
Remember that tatashe, habanero peppers (atarodo, ose oyibo, atarugu) and black peppers are all spicy hot so be careful about the quantities of these peppers you add.
Knoor cubes are boullion or seasoning cubes. I used chicken flavour because I cooked this Smoky Jollof Rice with chicken.
I use hen when preparing Party Jollof Rice because it is tastier than the soft chicken (rooster).
Nigerian curry powder is not spicy hot, it adds a nice flavour to this Smoky Party Jollof Rice.
Plum tomatoes are the tomatoes sold in Nigerian markets.
For best results in the Smoky Jollof Rice taste use tasteless and odourless vegetable oils: vegetable oils sold in Nigeria, Sunflower oil and Canola oil.
Liquid smoke, natural hickory flavour is the secret ingredient! See below for details of where to buy it from.

Cover the bowl with aluminium foil or thin plastic film and place in the fridge for at least 1 hour to marinate. For this barbecue chicken, I leave mine in the fridge overnight. This is so that the seasoning and spices will have time to seep into the chicken making it taste better.
When the desired time has elapsed, set your oven to top and down heating (bake) and 220°C or 425F and leave to preheat for about 10 minutes.
Line your oven tray with a baking sheet and gently lay the marinated drumsticks flat on the baking sheet. You can also use aluminium foil if you do not have a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, turning the drumsticks on the other side from time to time. It is ready when you notice some browning on the drumsticks.
Using a brush, apply one coat of barbecue sauce all over the chicken drumsticks.
Put back in the oven for about 5 minutes and apply another coat.
Repeat this process of applying a thin coat of barbecue sauce, putting back in the oven to dry a bit till you get the coverage you want.

Nigerian Peppered Gizzards Recipe,"
Add the stock cube, the thyme and big chunks of onions into the gizzards. If you marinated them, just add the onions.
Pour water to just under the level of the gizzards and start cooking at medium heat. This quantity of water will dry up by the time the gizzards are well done.
When the gizzards are well done, remove the big chunks of onions.
Increase the heat to high and stir constantly till all the remaining liquid in the pot is absorbed. You don't want to lose any flavour by pouring away the gizzard stock.
Add salt to taste and stir very well.
Lay the gizzards flat in a baking bowl.
Grill in an oven at 170°C or 338°F till the top side is dry and brown. Turn them and grill the underside too till dry and brown. If you don't have an oven, just deep-fry them.
Heat the vegetable oil in another pot.
Add the pepper and the grilled/deep-fried gizzards.
Stir very well till the pepper is evenly distributed on the gizzards. The vegetable oil ensures that this happens and gives the grilled gizzards a nice glow.
That's it! Insert toothpicks and serve.

Beef Skewers (Stick Meat),"
After about 1 hour, bring out the marinated beef and place in a pot. Add a few drops of water to help with the simmering, cover and start cooking at medium heat.
Once the underside turns pale, flip the beef pieces to cook the top side as well. You don't need to do this if you are cooking a full pot of beef.
When the top side turns pale, flip the beef pieces on any other sides that are still red, cook these till all the beef looks pale.
Now, start stirring the beef constantly till all the water is absorbed. You don't want to lose any flavour by pouring away the beef stock. Add salt to taste and set this aside.
In a different pot, heat some vegetable oil. You need at least a depth of 3 inches of vegetable oil.
When hot, fry the beef pieces till brown and dry. Remember to stir constantly while frying so the pieces will brown evenly.
When done, put the beef pieces in a sieve lined with paper towels and leave to cool.
When cool, thread the fried beef and vegetables one after the other onto the beef sticks. The way you combine the beef and vegetables is entirely up to you but make sure the final product looks colourful and appetizing.

Nigerian Beans Porridge,"
Put the beans in a pot and pour water up to the level of the beans and start cooking.

Note: If you have a pressure cooker, beans is one of the staple foods you will want to use it for. It reduces the cooking time considerably.
        

Cook till tender, adding more water from time to time, if necessary. Always keep the water at the same level as the beans so that when the beans is done, you will not have too much water in the porridge.
When the beans porridge is soft, add the onions, crayfish (if using it), pepper and seasoning.
Add the red palm oil, salt to taste and cook for more 5 minutes on medium heat.

Note:To get the most out of beans, it is best to cook it with one of the following: sweet yam, ripe/unripe plantain, sweet potatoes or baby corn. If you will add any of these, this is when to do so. Then instead of cooking for 5 minutes, cook till the added yam / plantain / potatoes is done. The baby corn should be added when you turn off the heat in step 5.
        

Turn off the heat, add the baby corn (if you have chosen to use it), leave to stand for 5 minutes and turn the porridge with a wooden spoon.

Nigerian Moi Moi,"
Blend the beans, tatashe or tomato puree, onions, crayfish, habanero pepper and ground nutmeg together with some of the water and pour the mix into a big enough bowl. 
Add the vegetable oil and the bone marrow stock (if this is what you have chosen to add to your moi moi).
Slowly add the remaining water and stir the mixture at the same time till you get a good mix of all the ingredients.
Add salt to taste and stir very well.

Note: Moi Moi is one of the Nigerian food recipes that is prepared cold. All the mixing and adding of ingredients is done off the stove. That is to say, once you start cooking, there is no going back! You cannot decide to add more salt or seasoning or a new ingredient later. So getting it right at the mixing stage is very important.
        

Pad the base of a big pot, pour some water and set on the stove. The depth of the water should be at most 1 inch.
Dish the Moi moi mix into containers of your choice, add egg/bone marrow/corned beef to each container, seal/cover and set them in the pot.
Add as small quantity of water as possible at a time while cooking the Moi Moi as detailed in preparation and use of moi moi containers so that the moi moi will not become watery when done. This is the case especially when using aluminium foil or uma leaves.
The length of time you will cook your Moi Moi depends on the quantity and the Moi Moi container you used.
        The Moi Moi that gets done quickest is the one wrapped in Uma or Banana leaves, followed by Moi Moi wrapped in aluminum foils then the one that takes the most time is Moi Moi cooked in aluminium or plastic plates.
        But whatever Moi Moi container you use, it is advisable to cook your Moi Moi for at least 1 hour, before checking it. Confirm that it is done by putting a knife through it, if the knife is stained with Moi Moi paste, then the Moi Moi is not done, but if the knife just has a slight smear of Moi Moi, then it's done. Also, when you cut through the Moi Moi, the insides will be set and not watery.
        If you are cooking a few wraps of Moi Moi in a small pot on high heat, then it will only take about 45 minutes to get done while when you are cooking a large pot of Moi Moi, it will definitely take more than one hour.

Grilled Chicken,"
Cut up the whole chicken to desired pieces. Most grocers or meat sellers will do this for you and save you the job.
Put the chicken pieces in a pot; add diced onions, thyme and stock cubes.
Pour enough water to just cover the contents of the pot and start cooking.
Since the hen is tough, it takes quite some time to get it well cooked. It usually takes me one hour 15 minutes on medium heat with a normal cooking pot to get it done to the way I like it. Depending on the heating capacity of your cooker, this may take less. Also if you use a pressure cooker, it will take even much less time so keep an eye on it so that it does not get too soft.
When the chicken is done, add some salt, cover the pot and leave to simmer for about 2 minutes. Adding salt at the beginning will make your chicken cook in more time because salt toughens the chicken and some other food stuff.
Transfer the chicken to a sieve to drain.
Then place them on your oven rack, place the rack as close to the grill (the top heater in your oven) as possible.
Switch your oven to ""Grill"" or if you are in the USA, ""Broil"" and set the temperature to 170°C or 338°F.
When the top side becomes brown, turn the pieces of chicken on the other side.
The chicken is well-grilled when both sides are brown.

Chicken: Hen (female chicken) is tougher and tastier than cockerel (male chicken) so when you go to buy chicken, ask your grocer or meat seller for the hen. This is called Gallina in Spanish. You should also buy a whole chicken and cut it up in pieces. Not only is it cheaper but you get the different parts of the chicken which adds to the flavour rather than just one part.
Onions: White, yellow or red onions. Onions are very important when seasoning chicken.
Thyme: This is very essential due to the aroma it adds to the chicken.
Stock cubes: Maggi or Knorr are the brands that bring out the best taste in Nigerian recipes.
Salt: Use salt sparingly when seasoning your chicken. Salt should be added when the chicken is done. Never add salt to raw chicken, see notes below for more information on what adding salt too early does to your chicken or beef.

Asun: Spicy Barbecued Goat Meat,"
After about 1 hour or the number of hours you chose to marinate the goat meat, put the meat in a pot. Use a pressure cooker if you have one because goat meat is quite tough and you will save lots of gas and electricity.
Pour water to just half of the level of the goat meat, add the big chunks of onion and start cooking at medium heat. You do not want a lot of water because you want the water to dry up by the time the goat meat is well done.
When the goat meat is well done, remove the big chunks of onions and add salt to taste.
Increase the heat to high and stir constantly till all the remaining liquid in the pot is absorbed. You don't want to lose any flavour by pouring away the goat meat stock.
Lay the goat meat flat on your oven rack.
Grill/Broil in the oven at 180°C or 350°F till the meat is brown all over. You will need to turn them from time to time. The meat should not be dry. This takes a maximum of 15 minutes with my oven.
While you are grilling the meat, wash, cut and thread the green bell pepper, red bell pepper and the remaining onion on toothpicks.
When the meat it well grilled/broiled, heat the vegetable oil in a dry clean pot.
Add the pepper and the thick stock from cooking the meat (if any) and fry for a bit.
Add the grilled goat meat.
Stir very well till the pepper is evenly distributed on the goat meat. The vegetable oil ensures that this happens and gives the Asun a nice glow.
That's it! Serve with the threaded vegetables.

Beer Battered Fish,"
Cut the fish into thin slices, say 1 cm thick. You want the fish to be done by the time the batter is crispy.
Cut the onion into big chunks.
Crush the stock cubes and mix with the ground pepper.
Season 2 tablespoons of flour with the stock cube/pepper mix. Set aside.
Season the fish with the same mix and set aside.
Set some vegetable oil on the stove to heat up. The oil should be 2 to 3 inches deep.
Put the remaining flour in a separate bowl. Add some of the seasoning mentioned above.
Add small quantities of beer at a time to the seasoned flour and mix as you go till you get a light flowing batter similar to pancake batter.
When the oil is hot, dab a piece of fish in the seasoned flour making sure that the flour covers all the fish. This helps more batter adhere to the fish.
Dip the dabbed fish in the batter making sure all parts of the fish are covered before putting it in the oil. Repeat the process for as many pieces of fish your frying container will allow without overcrowding.
Fry at medium heat till light brown and crispy.

Once the underside turns pale, flip the beef pieces to cook the top side as well. You don't need to do this if you are cooking a full pot of beef.
When the top side turns pale, flip the beef pieces on any other sides that are still red, cook these till all the beef looks pale.
Now, start stirring the beef constantly till all the water is absorbed. You don't want to lose any flavour by pouring away the beef stock. Add salt to taste and set this aside.

Boiled Groundnuts (Boiled Peanuts),"
Wash the groundnuts (peanuts) thoroughly. Groundnut is a root crop so you need to wash thoroughly to wash off all that loamy soil.
Set a generous quantity of water in a pot to boil.
When the water boils very well, add the washed groundnuts.
Stir, cover the pot and let it continue cooking.
Once it starts boiling again, let it boil for another 12 to 15 minutes.
It should be cooked after 15 minutes, you can smell it and when you open the shell, you will see that there is a difference in colour between the cooked one and the raw one.
Add some salt. The quantity depends on the quantity of groundnuts you are cooking. I would add half a teaspoon if I were cooking 2 cups of peanuts/groundnuts.
Cover and let it boil again for 2 more minutes. So 2 science rules to obey here: let the water boil before adding the groundnuts then add salt only when it is done. Adding salt at the beginning hardens the groundnuts hence they take longer to cook.
Pour out into a sieve and cool it down with cool water.

Easiest Nigerian Puff Puff Recipe,"
Sift the pizza flour into a clean dry bowl, add the nutmeg, sugar and salt. Mix well.
Add warm water and mix till everything is well combined.
Cover the bowl with aluminum foil or plastic film and place in a warm place to rise for 45 minutes or till double in size.
Pour some oil in a deep pot and allow to heat up. The oil should be at least 3 inches deep. This is to give room for the puff puffs to swim in the oil. It's not advisable to use a deep fryer for Puff Puff because of the netting but if you want to use it, set the temperature to 170°C.
Test that the oil is hot enough by putting a drop of batter into the oil. If it sizzles and comes up to the surface of the oil, then the oil is hot enough. If the oil is not hot enough, the batter will go down to the bottom of the oil and stay there.
When the oil is hot enough, scoop some batter into the oil with an ice cream scoop. See video below.
Put in more scoops of the batter, as much as the space in the frying pot will allow without overcrowding.
Reduce the heat to medium.
Once the underside of the puff puff has turned golden brown, flip the ball so that the topside will be fried as well.
When the puff puff balls are golden all over, take them out and place in a sieve lined with paper towels.

Easiest Nigerian Chin Chin Recipe,"
Sift the flour into a big enough bowl.
Add the granulated sugar and ground nutmeg and mix.
Add the margarine in small scoops. Then rub it into the flour till you get a good mix that feels like crumbs.
If you are using eggs, break and add them now and mix very well with the contents of the bowl.
Add the peak milk, mix with a spatula. Then knead by hand till a ball of dough is formed. It may feel dry during the mixing but do not be tempted to add more liquid because the liquid you have in the bowl should be enough. You just need a bit of arm power to mix it. But if you really really can't get it to form a dough, add a tiny quantity of water bit by bit till the dough is formed.
When done, cover the bowl and leave the dough to rest for about 15 minutes.
After 15 minutes, you will notice that the dough is softer. Knead very well.
Roll out small bits of dough and cut with a knife or a pizza cutter as shown in the video below. Do not use flour to dust Nigerian Chin Chin because this causes the oil to foam during frying. If you mixed the Chin Chin very well, there will be no need to for dusting while cutting the chin chin.
Pour a generous quantity of vegetable oil into a deep pot and set your stove to high heat. Chin Chin fries best on high heat. 
As the oil heats up, test the temperature with one piece of raw chin chin. If the oil is hot enough, the piece of chin chin should sizzle and come up to the surface almost immediately.
Once you confirm that the oil is hot enough, gently collect some chin chin from the side of the mound of diced raw chin chin with both hands and throw into the hot oil. Do not overcrowd them.
Start stirring immediately with a metallic spoon, shaking the spoon from side to side till all the pieces of Chin Chin come apart.
After that, keep stirring at intervals till the Chin Chin browns to your liking. Remember, the Chin Chin will go one shade darker when you take them off the oil.
When happy, scoop into a sieve lined with a paper towel. Then fry the rest of the diced raw chin chin in batches.
After some time, spread them on a cold hard surface lined with newspapers and paper towels so they can cool down completely.
When completely cool, store in airtight containers. Place it on your kitchen counter, in the fridge or in the freezer.

Recipe for Nigerian Egg Roll,"
Do mix the dough with lukewarm water.
If your yeast is not as powdered as mine (see video), mix it separately with lukewarm water before adding it to the rest of the ingredients.
Heat up the oil at any temperature but reduce the heat to low before frying the egg rolls. I found that the outsides brown too quickly and if the oil is too hot, the insides of your egg roll will not be well done by the time the outside is brown or even burnt.
You only need to wrap the egg with a thin dough. If you want to make the dough thick so that the egg rolls will be as big as the ones sold in Nigeria, the insides will not be done by the time the outside starts burning. I tried everything possible, fried it with very low heat to no avail so there must be a secret to how the Nigerian ones are made. I'm still looking into that. But don't worry too much about the thickness, the taste is the same.

Kilishi (Nigerian Beef Jerky),"
Cut the beef into very thin fillets if it has not been done for you by the butchers.
Cut off all traces of fat from the beef.
Set your oven to 250°C (475F) or Gas Mark 9 to preheat. If your oven temperature settings are not up to these, use the highest possible setting but this means that your own drying times will change. If your oven has a fan, turn it on as well because it helps dry the beef faster.
Sprinkle a tiny quantity of salt on the fillets of beef and spread them around. You only need a tiny quantity and you can skip salt altogether.
Line your oven tray with a baking sheet and lay the pieces of beef flat on it.
Put the tray of beef into the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Flip the beef every 5 minutes for even drying.
After 15 minutes, bring out the beef from the oven and brush the Kilishi all over them, making sure that both sides of the beef are well covered.
	Note: 
	The way they do it in the North is to dry the fillets of beef in the sun for 2 days then soak them in the Kilishi spice solution and spread in the sun (on flat rafia baskets) till dry.
	Some grill it after soaking in the Kilishi solution.
Put them back in the oven and bake for additional 10 to 15 minutes. Flip them from time to time and this time, keep a very good eye on it else it will become bone dry. You want it dry and chewy not crunchy.

Nigerian Meat Pie Recipe,"
Put the 1 kg of flour in a sizeable bowl; add 2 teaspoons of baking powder and 2 pinches of salt. You really do not need a lot of salt for the meat pie dough. The meat pie will get most of its taste from the filling. Mix these dry ingredients very well.
Use a tablespoon to scoop the margarine in small bits into the bowl of flour. The smaller you make the bits of margarine, the easier it will be for you to rub them into the flour.
Use finger tips to rub the margarine into the flour till the mix becomes like crumbs.
Note: In Nigeria, we also refer to margarine as butter but for my audience in the Western countries, please do NOT use butter for the meatpie dough because butter is too hard and this makes it difficult for you to mix it with the flour to achieve the crumbly look. So please use margarine. 
Also butter is quite heavy so it makes the dough very greasy which hinders the elasticity of the dough.
Can I use melted butter? No, because it simply ruins the meat pie.
Now, start adding cold water in bits while at the same time folding the mix till a stiff ball of dough is formed. You will be surprised at how small quantity of water you need to get the dough stiff. At most, all you need for the 1 kg of flour is half a cup of water.
Knead the dough very well, put back in the bowl and leave to rest for 5 to 7 minutes. This makes the dough more elastic.

Place the beef flat on the oven rack and put in the oven to roast.
After 15 – 20 minutes, flip the beef to roast the underside as well. The length of time you’ll roast each side depends on how thick the fillets are. So total roasting time for both sides of the beef is 30 – 40 minutes.
Rub some of the remaining groundnut oil on both sides of the beef. Increase the oven temperature a bit and roast either side of the beef for 5 minutes each.




That's it!

Note: The oil should be at least 3 inches deep. This is so that the puff puff will become spherical when scooped into the oil. You don't want to end up with flat Pancakes. lol


Test that the oil is hot enough by putting a drop of batter into the oil. If it sizzles and comes up to the surface of the oil, then the oil is hot enough. If the oil is not hot enough, the batter will go down to the bottom of the oil and stay there.
When the oil is hot enough, scoop some batter into the oil with your hand by pressing the batter to come out from between your thumb and index finger. You should see the video for this technique as this is what will make your Puff Puff have a near-perfect spherical shape.
Put in more scoops of the batter, as much as the space in the frying pot will allow without overcrowding.
Once the underside of the puff puff has turned golden brown, flip the ball so that the topside will be fried as well.
When both sides are golden brown, take out the puff puff balls and place in a sieve. If you want to reduce the oil on your Puff Puff as much as possible, then line your sieve with paper towels. The paper towels help soak away the excess oil on the puff puff.

Catfish Pepper Soup (Point and Kill),"
To prepare Cat Fish Pepper Soup, wash and cut the cat fish into 1-inch thick slices. Boil some hot water and pour on the pieces of fish, stir and remove immediately. This toughens the skin of the fish so that it does not fall apart during cooking.




Now it is time to prepare the 'secret' ingredient. Using an old frying pan, roast the Ehu seeds (stirring constantly) till you can smell it. Don't worry you will know when it is OK to take it off because it has a distinctive aroma. Another way to know that it is OK is to take one of the seeds and try to remove the outer membrane. If the membrane comes off easily, then the Ehu is done.




Peel off the membrane from all the Ehu seeds and grind with a dry mill.
Cut the onions into tiny pieces.

Before preparing the soup, soak the dry fish for about half an hour. If you are using the very tough stockfish, boil it for 20 minutes and leave in the pot with the hot water to soak for about an hour. If using the softer stockfish, you can just soak them in cool water till you can break them apart with your hands.
When the fish and stockfish are soft, debone and break them into sizeable chunks.
Much closer to your cooking time, grind the egusi with a dry mill. Grind the crayfish and the dry pepper separately and set aside. Wash the vegetable to be used. Cut into tiny pieces.

Nigerian Egusi Soup (Fried Method),"
Pour the red palm oil into a dry pot and set on the stove to heat. As soon as the oil melts, add the ground egusi and start frying. If the oil is not congealed, add the egusi as soon as the oil is translucent. Mix the ground egusi with oil till every grain of egusi turns yellow. 
Start stirring the egusi on low to medium heat. Keep stir-frying for about 10 minutes.
Add the meat/fish stock (water from cooking the fish and meat) little by little while still stirring the egusi. So you add a bit of the stock, stir-fry for some time, add another, stir-fry and so on. When the stock is exhausted and you feel that the soup is still too thick, you can start adding hot water in the same way till you get the consistency you want. If your choice of vegetable is bitter leaf, add it at this time.
Cover the pot and cook for 20 minutes, stirring at intervals. Also, top up the water when necessary. If you don't stir it, it will burn. It takes 30 minutes to cook egusi properly else the soup will not taste nice to someone with authentic Nigerian taste buds. Also, egusi that is not cooked long enough may cause upset stomach. The egusi is done when you notice that the oil has separated from the mix. 
Once you are happy that it is done, add the ground crayfish and pepper. Stir and add the Nigerian pumpkin leaves or spinach (alternative).
Stir very well and add the cooked stockfish, shaki and meat.
Add salt if necessary. If it is too thick, add some water to bring it to a consistency you like.
Cover and leave to simmer and it is done!

Gbegiri Soup,"
Put the peeled and soaked beans into a sizeable pot. Pour water to cover the beans and start cooking at medium heat.
While the beans is cooking, prepare the Ewedu Soup which is used to eat the Gbegiri Soup.
Cook the beans till they become so soft that it practically melts when you mash it with your fingers. This takes about 1 hour. You will need to top up the water from time to time but make sure the water is always at the same level as the beans. This ensures that you have just the right amount of water in the soup when the beans is done.
When the beans is well done and soft, blend it. It is not advisable to blend hot food in blenders with plastic jugs so if your blender has a plastic jug, seive the soft beans with a sieve that has a mire mesh.
Pour the beans into a pot and set back on the stove, add the smoked fish, salt, pepper, crayfish, stock cube and palm oil.
Cover the pot and cook at low heat for about 5 minutes or till the oil blends with the rest of the ingredients. This is when the oil changes from red to yellow.
Stir from time to time so it does not burn.
That's it! The Gbegiri Soup is done.

Nigerian Groundnut Soup (Peanut Soup),"
Start cooking the shaki first as it is the toughest meat in the bunch. Always keep water to the same level as the contents of the pot and top it up as you cook.
When the shaki starts to curl, add the dry fish and stockfish.
When the shaki is almost done, add beef and stock cubes and cook till all the meat and fish are well done.
Add the crayfish, salt and pepper, cover and cook till it boils.
Transfer the meat and fish to another pot/container leaving the stock in the pot.
Add the ground groundnuts and stir very well till there are no lumps. Reduce the heat to very low and start cooking.
Stir every 5 minutes and top up the water if necessary. This mixture burns easily so watch it closely and stir as often as necessay.
Cook till a thin film of clear oil appears on the surface. This should take about 15 minutes. Add palm oil and stir very well. 
Add the beef and fish, stir and cook on low heat till it boils. For those who prefer their groundnut soup without vegetables, the soup is ready at this time. If you prefer it with vegetables then go to step 10. 
Add the vegetables, stir and leave to simmer. Stir again and it is done.

Miyan Kuka (Baobab Leaves Soup),"
Cook the cow ribs with the seasoning cubes and onion.
When the meat is done, turn off the heat, remove the chunks of onion then take out the meat from the beef stock.
Add the kuka powder, spreading over the meat stock as you add. Then stir very well with a slotted spoon to ensure that you get a smooth mix without lumps.
Add the pepper, crayfish and dawa dawa blend and palm oil. Stir very well.

Nsala Soup,"
Place the catfish in a pot and pour enough water to cover the fish. Add the seasoning and cook till done. Feel free to add beef and dry fish to this soup recipe. 
When the catfish is almost done, add the crayfish, pepper and utazi leaves blend. Also add the yam paste in small lumps and salt to taste.

Note: Catfish is what makes Nsala soup what it is, giving it the unique taste that it has so it is essential to this recipe. The only other fish that I have found to be close to Cat fish as regards to this recipe is Conger Eel.
        

Cover the pot and allow the contents to cook at high heat till all the yam paste have dissolved. While cooking, if you think that the yam paste will make the soup too thick, you can remove some that are yet to dissolve.

Ofe Achara with Akpuruakpu Egusi (Mgbam),"
Cook the stockfish with the stock cubes (seasoning cubes) till soft and pour some of the stock into a bowl. Yes, this has been soaked earlier but stockfish is quite tough and soaking alone does not get it as soft as we need it. The soaking is necessary so that it can be cleaned very well.
Pour most of the ground egusi (about 70%) into a clean dry bowl.
Season the egusi with dry pepper and some of the crayfish and ogiri okpei blend. It's important to season the egusi very well so that the mgbam will not taste bland when one bites into it.
Add some of the fish stock to the egusi and mix till a thick dough is formed.
Mold the egusi dough into flat discs, as big as a coin and set aside.
Boil some water and throw the molded egusi into the pot of boiling water. Cook for 10 minutes on medium heat.
Set the pot of stockfish on the stove. It should still contain some stock from cooking the stockfish. If not, add the water from boiling the egusi balls.
Add the deboned dry fish, habanero pepper and the remaining crayfish and ogiri okpei blend and bring to a boil.
Once it boils, take off the fish and set aside.
Add the remaining ground egusi to the stock, stir and cook till you see some clear egusi oil come to the surface. This should take 15 to 20 minutes. Stir the soup often so it does not burn. Add the water you used in boiling the molded egusi when necessary.
Once you are sure you see some clear oil at the top, add palm oil and cook for 5 minutes.
Add the boiled akpuruakpu egusi, achara, okazi and the fish we took out earlier.
Add salt to your taste, cover and once it boils again, it is done!

Ofe Ugba (Oil Bean Soup),"
Place the stockfish in a pot, add some water and start cooking. Add water in small amounts and top up when necessary because you want as little water as possible in the pot when done. I use a pressure pot to cook stockfish, softens in no time.
When the stock fish is soft, use the cooking spoon to break it into small pieces.
Add the dry fish, ugba, crayfish and ogiri okpei, pepper, onions, smoked fish, salt and palm oil. Cover the pot and continue cooking on high heat. Stir often so it does not burn.
After about 5 minutes, add the leafy vegetable and okra, stir and add salt if necessary. You want as small quantity of water as possible in the soup before adding the vegetable. I used leafy spinach, watch the video below to see how I pre-prepared the leafy spinach before adding it to the soup.
Take the pot off the stove and transfer to another container immediately so that the green vegetables stay green.

Ogbono Soup,"
Pour the palm oil into a clean dry stainless steel or aluminium pot. Set on the stove and melt the oil at low heat. Remember, only melt the oil, do not allow it to heat up.
Once melted, turn off the heat and add the ground Ogbono.
Use your cooking spoon to dissolve the Ogbono in the oil.
When all the Ogbono powder has completely mixed with the oil, add the meat/fish stock (water from cooking the assorted meat and fish). Set the heat of your cooker to low and start stirring. You will notice the Ogbono start to thicken and draw.
Keep stirring till the Ogbono has completely absorbed the meat stock.
Add a small quantity of the hot water and stir till the Ogbono has absorbed all the water. Repeat this process till you get a consistency that is shown in the video below.
Making sure that your heat is set to low, cover the pot and start cooking. Once it starts to simmer, stir every 2-3 minutes for 20 minutes. 
So what you'll do is: every 3 minutes or so, open the pot, stir every well, scraping the Ogbono that sticks to the base of the pot, cover the pot and cook for another 3 minutes.
After 20 minutes, the Ogbono should be well cooked and you will begin to perceive its nice flavour and aroma.
Add the assorted meat and fish, ground crayfish, salt and pepper to taste. The Ogbono may have become thicker from the cooking. If so, add a little bit more water and stir very well. Cover and cook till the contents of the pot is well heated up.
If you prefer your Ogbono Soup without vegetables, turn off the heat and serve but if you like to add a vegetable then keep reading 🙂
When the contents of the pot have heated up, add the vegetable (frozen Spinach used in the video). Stir very well, cover the pot and turn off the heat. Leave to stand for about 5 minutes and serve with any Fufu recipe.

Ogbono Soup: Easiest Ogbono Soup Recipe,"
Cook the assorted meat with the seasoning cubes and onion. Remember to start cooking the toughest part of meat first (eg shaki), then add beef when almost done.
When the meat is done, turn off the heat, remove the chunks of onion then take out the meat from the beef stock.
Add the ground ogbono, spreading over the meat stock as you add. Then stir very well with a slotted spoon to ensure that they mix with the beef stock without lumps.
When happy, cover the pot, turn on the heat to very low and start cooking. Yes, you can cover the pot while cooking Ogbono Soup and the elasticity will not be affected. There are a few reasons why your Ogbono Soup does not have the perfect elasticity but covering the pot is not one of those reasons. See below.
Stir the soup very often as you cook so it does not burn.
After 15 minutes, add the crayfish and ogiri okpei blend, habanero pepper, deboned dry cat fish, salt and palm oil in no particular order and continue cooking. Remember to stir often.
After 5 minutes (a total of 20 minutes of cooking), add the remaining ingredients: the boiled meats we took out earlier and leafy vegetables. You can add more salt if necessary. For vegetables, I add, stir, add, stir till I am happy with the ratio of the vegetables to the soup. This is how I add vegetables to almost all Nigerian soups.
Note: 
You need to cook Ogbono for at least 20 minutes for the delicious taste and flavour to come out. You will know when you have cooked it long enough because you can even smell this delicious aroma when it happens. If you have ever wondered why your Ogbono Soup does not taste as delicious as that one you ate somewhere else, it may well be that you are not cooking yours for long enough.

Cover the pot and at the first sign of it boiling again, it's done!
Take the soup off the stove immediately and pour into another pot (cold pot) or the container(s) you will use to freeze it. This ensures that the vegetables retain their green colour. Though you have turned off the heat, if you leave the soup in the hot pot, the vegetables will continue to cook and will turn dark and unappetising. 
This is even worse if you have a vitro ceramic cooker (hot plate kind of cooker) that still has lots of residual heat long after you have turned off the heat. Pouring the soup into a cold container stops the cooking process. 
After pouring the soup into the new container(s), leave them on your kitchen counter to cool down completely before freezing.

If you will use shaki (cow tripe) for the soup, wash and boil till it is done. Add water sparingly because this soup needs to be thick. Add the soaked stockfish and dry fish to the cooked shaki. The length of time it will take to cook shaki depends on the cooking appliance utilized. You can take a bite to confirm this.
When you are happy that the shaki and stock fish are well-done, add the beef, onions and stock cubes and cook till done. Then add the iced fish and cook till done.
Pour red palm oil in another pot and heat the pot to dissolve the oil if it is congealed. Add the diced okra and start frying to kick-start the drawing process, add some meat stock from time to time till you notice the okra start to draw.

Nigerian Pepper Soup with Assorted Meat,"
This cooking direction describes Chicken Pepper Soup. To prepare Goat Meat Pepper Soup, Cow Foot Pepper Soup or Assorted Beef Pepper Soup just substitute chicken with cow foot or beef and offal respectively.
Place the pieces of chicken in a pot and pour enough water to cover the contents of the pot. Add the stock cubes, thyme and onions and cook till done.

Note: When cooking Assorted Beef Pepper Soup, you should cook the shaki for sometime before adding the other beef parts. Shaki is tough and will take longer to cook than the other beef parts. 
Cow foot is a tough part of meat so when cooking Cow Foot Pepper Soup, you should use a pressure cooker if you have one. This will save you some gas or electricity.


By now, you will notice that some of the water has dried. Add more water to bring it to the level of the contents of the pot.
Add the ground Ehu, dry uziza, chilli pepper and salt to taste. Ehu has some spicy taste so you should add chilli pepper with care. Even though it is called pepper soup, you still want to be able to taste and enjoy the recipe itself. Too much chilli pepper will ruin it for you.
Cover the pot and leave to boil for 5 minutes and the pepper soup is ready.

Nigerian Beef and Chicken Stew,"
Grind / Blend the chilli pepper and cut the onions into small pieces.
Start preparing the tomato stew by following the steps at: How to Prepare Tomato Stew
Cut up the chicken and cook with half of the chopped onions, stock cubes and thyme. When the chicken is almost done, add the beef and cook till well done. Then add salt, allow to simmer for about 5 minutes, transfer to a sieve to drain. Grill or fry the chicken and beef. This is optional but it gives them a rich golden look.

Notes about cooking the chicken:
Add water up to the level of the contents of the pot when cooking the chicken.
When cooking chicken, I do not add salt to the raw chicken. This is because salt closes the pores of the chicken (and infact anything you are cooking), this prevents the natural flavour of the chicken from coming out into the surrounding water and prevents the seasoning from entering the chicken to improve the taste. The result is that your chicken stock will not have a rich natural taste. It will only have an artifical taste of seasoning.
Salt also hardens the chicken hence it takes longer to cook.
I only add salt when the chicken is done. A lot of people think that adding salt early makes the chicken taste better but there's a big difference between a salty taste and a rich taste. I believe that what gives food a rich taste is not salt but the natural flavour of the food so allow this natural flavour to come out into your stock by NOT adding salt too early. And remember, stock cubes already contain salt so you really don't need more salt.
I do not use curry powder to season my chicken (or beef) simply because in my opinion, curry powder overtakes the taste of any food it is cooked with (except Fried Rice) and makes the food taste so artificial. But if you don't mind it, feel free to use it as seasoning for your beef or chicken.

How to Cook Ewa Agoyin,"
Cook the beans till done. For Ewa Agoyin, the beans needs to be very soft.

Note: If you have a pressure cooker, beans is one of the staple foods you will want to use it for. It considerably reduces the cooking time.
        

When the beans is done, add salt, leave to dry up all the water and set aside.
To cook the Agoyin, pour the palm oil into a separate dry pot. Allow to heat up till the oil starts smoking and the red colour changes to clear. It is better to do this at medium heat so that the oil does not get too hot too quickly. Remember to turn off your smoke alarm before doing this. 🙂 
        To keep the smoke to a minimum and still have the traditional taste of Ewa Agoyin, I use vegetable oil and when it is very hot, I add a small amount of palm oil. Watch the video below to see how I do that.
Now add the precooked onions and stir continuously till the onions is fully caramelized. It should be very dark in colour.
Add the parboiled tomato puree and stir continuously till you cannot tell the difference between the tomatoes and onions.
Add the pepper, crayfish, stock cubes and salt to taste. You can also add a little water at this point if your want.
Stir very well and bring to the boil. The Ewa Agoyin is ready!

Meatball Stew,"
Put the minced meat in a bowl.
Add crushed garlic, 1 teaspoon of thyme, 1 teaspoon of ground black pepper and 2 small stock cubes (crushed) to the minced meat. If using big stock cubes, add 1 at this time.
Mix well with your hand till everything is well incorporated.
Set your oven to 200°C (400F) to preheat. 
Mold the minced meat into small balls, a bit bigger than table tennis balls. When molding, do not press too hard so that the meat balls will not be rock solid when done. Just use your finger tips to gently form the balls. I usually get 10 meatballs from 500g of minced beef. Click the raw meat balls image to enlarge. 
Place the meatballs in an oven tray and bake in the preheated oven for a total of 20 minutes. While baking, turn the meat balls around at least once so that they will cook evenly. You can also shallow fry them but I don't like doing that because for me, the meat balls are not evenly cooked when fried. Fry if you do not have an oven. This is what the meat balls should look like when done. Click the image to enlarge. 
Set a pot on the stove and add the conc. Tomato Stew.
Add the meat stock. The consistency of the tomato stew should be medium. If you do not have meat stock, just add water.
Add the remaining thyme, ground black pepper and stock cubes. Then add salt to taste.
Stir very well and gently add the baked meat balls one by one into the stew.
Cover and leave to simmer on LOW heat so that the stew will slowly come to a boil.
Once it heats up very well, the Meatball Stew is done! If you are using curry leaves or fresh basil, add them at this time, stir and take the stew off the stove.

How to Prepare Nigerian Pepper Sauce,"
Wash and chop the onions and pepper into very tiny pieces. If you have mortar and pestle, then no need to cut the pepper, just pound it with the chopped onions. 
When the pepper and onions have medium smoothness, transfer to a bowl. Then add some palm oil till you get the consistency you want.

Note: If the oil is congealed, place the container in a bowl of hot water for some time to melt it. You can also melt it in the microwave. You can increase the quantity of peppers if you prefer your pepper sauce very hot.
            

Add salt to taste and your pepper sauce is ready.
You can heat the pepper sauce up a bit before use.

Dice one onion and slice the other.
Rinse and remove the seeds from the tatashe. It is advisable to deseed the tatashe peppers because the seeds have a tendency to make your stews bitter. Also, there is a tendency that your blender cannot grind the seeds and this is unsightly when you serve your stews.
I also deseed the habanero peppers. I am an Igbo gal and usually the spiciness in the flesh of these habanero peppers is enough to give me the desired bite. But if you wish to set your mouth on fire, like you are eating Vindaloo please add as much habanero peppers as you wish. lol
Blend all the peppers till smooth. I usually cut them up a bit to help my blender.

Tip: The smoothest puree usually settles at the bottom so you may want to use only that (if it is sufficient) and discard the frothy part at the top.

Vanilla Ice Cream,"
Pour the fresh milk and the whipping cream into a sizeable pot.
Add the vanilla extract. If you are using a vanilla pod, add everything (seeds and fibre) to the milk and whipping cream in the pot.
Start cooking on medium heat.
While waiting for that to boil, whisk the egg yolks very well. Add the sugar and mix well.
Once the contents of the pot start to boil, reduce the heat to very low. If you added vanilla pods, remove the fibre from the milk at this time.
Once you see that the milk is no longer foaming so much (due to the reduced heat), slowly add the egg yolks to the milk, whipping cream and vanilla mixture. Stir till well incorporated.
Increase the heat to medium and stir continuously till you notice the solution thickening. This should take about 10 minutes.
Once you are happy, place the ice cubes into the big bowl and add some water to them. Pour the ice cream mixture into the smaller bowl and place this bowl into the ice water bath. Stir the ice cream mixture continuously (with a spatula) till it cools down completely. You may need to watch the video below to see how I did this.
Place the bowl containing the ice cream mixture in the freezer. After 30 minutes, bring it out, stir very well with a spatula and place it back for another half an hour. Then bring it out and stir again. Repeat the process till a creamy solid is formed. It is important to stir very often because this prevents ice from forming in the ice cream. Depending on your freezer, this process takes between 3 and 5 hours.
Once you are happy with the texture of the ice cream, serve and decorate with honey, caramel and/or fruits.
If you have any left overs, put in a container, cover and place in your freezer till whenever. When you take it out of the freezer, it may appear rock solid unlike the ice cream purchased in the shops. All you have to do is leave it on your kitchen counter for 5 to 7 minutes or till it softens to ice cream texture before serving.

Iya Dun Dun Fried Yam,"
Peel and cut the yam tuber into tapered discs.
Rinse the yam cuts and place in a bowl. The number of pieces of yam in a batch must be the quantity you can fry at the same time so this depends on the size of your deep fryer or deep frying pot.
Add some water to the bowl. For about 8 pieces of yam, you should add about 3 tablespoons of water.
Toss the contents of the bowl to distribute the salt.
Pour some vegetable oil in a pot (at least 3 inches deep) and set on the stove to heat up. If you are using a deep fryer, pour enough vegetable oil into the fryer as per the instructions manual and preheat the oil to 190°C.
When the oil is very hot, carefully pour the contents of the bowl (water and yam pieces) into the hot oil and cover the pot. This is why it is important that you only put the quantity of yam pieces you can fry in one go into the bowl.
Leave it to cook-fry for a few minutes and stir. Be careful when stirring because the oil will be spattering due to the water in the oil.  
Note: With the water in the yam, the yams will be cooked for a bit before the frying starts. This is what makes the inside of the yam moist. The very hot oil ensures that the yam pieces are crunchy on the outside.

Keep stirring from time to time till you can feel the crunchiness when the spoon makes contact with the yam pieces. The tapered end will begin to brown a bit too.
When happy, transfer to a paper-lined sieve to drain and that's it!

Peel and cut the yam tuber into 1 inch cylindrical discs. Make several cuts across the discs to get large chips. Wash the yam chips and place in a bowl.
Add a little salt and toss the contents to distribute the salt.
If you are using a deep fryer, pour enough vegetable oil into the fryer as per the instructions manual and preheat the oil to 170°C. You can also use a pot to fry the yam chips. It is preferable to use a pot rather than a frying pan for this fried yam recipe because pots provide more depth for the frying process.
When the oil is heated, add a few yam chips, leaving enough room for flipping the chips.
Stir the chips till they have turned golden.
Remove the chips and place in paper towels to absorb the oil.
Fry the rest of the chips following steps 4 through 6.

Nigerian Roasted Yam,"
Pour out the water used in soaking the yam pieces.
Add some salt and toss to distribute evenly.
Place the yam pieces flat on the oven rack, set the oven to grill (broil) and roast at 150°C (300F) till the top side of the yams are light brown. 
Turn the yam pieces to roast the underside too till they are light brown all over.
When the yams are almost done, you can increase the temperature to 180°C (350F) so that the outside of the yam pieces will be very crunchy.
There are many ways to go about it. You can roast one side for 10 minutes, turn and roast the other side for 10 minutes etc. I roasted mine for a total of 30 minutes, increasing the temperature when the yams are almost done. Your own time may vary depending on the type and heating capacity of your oven.
They are done when the inside of the yams are moist and well done and the outside is light brown and crunchy.

Ji Mmanu (Palm Oil Yam),"
Peel and cut the white puna yam into small pieces.
Rinse them and put in a pot.
Pour water to just under the level of the yams. The plan is to have just a small quantity of water left in the pot by the time the pieces of yam are well cooked.
Add chunks of onion. I want to have onion flavour in the meal but I do not want to have pieces of onions in there that's why I use chunks here.
Add salted butter. If you use unsalted butter then you will need to add salt when the contents boil.
Cover and start cooking on high heat.
After about 20 minutes, the yam should be well cooked with a small amount of water left in it. Remove the chunks of onion, turn off the heat and set the pot aside for the yams to cool down a bit.
Mash the yam with a potato masher or any utensil that can do the job. You can use a pestle but do not mash it into a smooth paste like pounded yam.
After using the potato masher, follow it up with a spatula. The spatula helps make the dough smoother. Do not be tempted to add more water because this is not pounded yam. You want the yam mashed but it should still have the texture of a boiled piece of yam.
When the dough becomes a smooth, use an ice cream spoon to make balls of the dough.
Place the scoops of yam on a bed of spinach or garden egg leaves.
Sprinkle the pepper and pour the palm oil over the balls of yam. Spread the tiny pieces of spinach on top for effects.

Yam Balls (Ji Akpurakpu),"
Pour enough water to about the same level as the yam cubes, add the seasoning cube and black pepper and start cooking on medium heat.
After 30 minutes, the yam should be soft with a little water in the pot. Add salt and the cubes of butter, stir and set aside to cool down a bit.
Pour a little vegetable oil in a frying pan and fry the onions and peppers for about 7 minutes.
Mash the boiled yam, adding Peak Milk as you mash. You just need to mash the yam for a bit. See the video below.
Add the fried peppers and onions and mix very well. 
Set some vegetable oil in a deep pan to heat up. The oil should be 3 inches deep.
